wood engraving had fallen into almost utter neglect by the end of the
seventeenth century, and continued in a languishing state for many years
afterward, yet the art was never lost, as some persons have stated; for
both in England and in France a regular succession of wood engravers can
be traced from 1700 to the time of Thomas Bewick. The cuts which appear
in books printed in Germany, Holland, and Italy during the same period,
though of very inferior execution, sufficiently prove that the art
continued to be practised in those countries.</p>

<p>The first English book of this period which requires notice is an
edition of Howel’s Medulla Historiæ Anglicanæ, octavo, printed at London
in 1712.<a class = "tag" name = "tagVII1" id = "tagVII1" href =
"#noteVII1">VII.1</a> There are upwards of sixty wood-cuts in this work,
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page447" id = "page447">
447</a></span>
and the manner in which they are executed sufficiently indicates that
the engraver must have either been self-taught or the pupil of a master
who did not understand the art. The blocks have, for the most part, been
engraved in the manner of copper-plates; most of the lines, which a
regular wood engraver would have left in relief, are cut in
<i>intaglio</i>, and hence in the impression they appear white where
they ought to be black. The bookseller, in an address to the reader,
thus proceeds to show the advantages of those cuts, and to answer any
objection that might be urged against them on account of their being
engraved on wood. “The cuts added in this edition are intended more for
use than show. The utility consists in these two particulars. 1.&nbsp;To
make the better impression on the memory. 2.&nbsp;To show more readily
when the notable passages in our history were transacted; which, without
the knowledge of the names of the persons, are not to be found out, by
even the best indexes. As for example: In what reign was it that a
rebellious rout, headed by a vile fellow, made great ravage, and
appearing in the King’s presence with insolence, their captain was
stabbed upon the spot by the Lord-Mayor? Here, without knowing the names
of some of the parties, which a world of people are ignorant of, the
story is not to be found by an index; but by the help of the cut, which
catches the eye, is soon discovered. We all have heard of the piety of
one of our queens who sucked the poison out of her husband’s wound, but
very few remember which of them it was, which the cut presently shows.
The same is to be said of all the rest, since we have chosen only such
things as are <span class = "smallroman">NOTABILIA</span> in the history
to describe in our sculptures.&mdash;And if it be objected that the
graving is in wood, and not in copper, which would be more beautiful; we
answer, that such would be much more expensive too. And we were willing
to save the buyer’s purse; especially since even the best engraving
would not better serve the purposes above-said.”</p>

<p>Though no mark is to be found on any of those cuts, I am inclined to
think that they were executed by Edward Kirkall, whose name appears as
the engraver of the copper-plate frontispiece to the book. The accounts
which we have of Kirkall are extremely unsatisfactory. Strutt says that
he was born at Sheffield in 1695; and that, visiting London in search of
improvement, he was for some time employed in graving arms, stamps, and
ornaments for books. It is, however, likely that he was born previous to
1695; for the frontispiece to Howel’s
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page448" id = "page448">
448</a></span>
Medulla is dated 1712, when, if Strutt be correct, Kirkall would be only
seventeen. That he engraved on wood, as well as on copper, is
unquestionable; and I am inclined to think that he either occasionally
engraved small ornaments and head-pieces on type-metal for the use of
printers, or that casts in this kind of metal were taken from some of
his small cuts.<a class = "tag" name = "tagVII2" id = "tagVII2" href =
"#noteVII2">VII.2</a></p>

<p>The head-pieces and ornaments in Maittaire’s Latin Classics,
duodecimo, published by Tonson and Watts, 1713, were probably engraved
on wood by Kirkall, as his initials, E.&nbsp;K., are to be found on one
of the tail-pieces. Papillon speaks rather favourably of those small
cuts, though he objects to the uniformity of the tint and the want of
precision in the more delicate parts of the figures, such as the faces
and hands. He notices the tail-piece with the mark E.&nbsp;K. as one of
the best executed; and he suspects that these letters were intended for
the name of an English painter&mdash;called <i>Ekwits</i>, to the best
of his recollection,&mdash;who “taught the arts of painting and of
engraving on wood to J.&nbsp;B. Jackson, so well known to the printers
of Paris about 1730 from his having supplied them with so large a stock
of indifferent cuts.”<a class = "tag" name = "tagVII3" id = "tagVII3"
href = "#noteVII3">VII.3</a></p>

<p>The cuts in Croxall’s edition of Æsop’s Fables, first published by
J.&nbsp;and R.&nbsp;Tonson and J.&nbsp;Watts, in 1722, were, in all
probability, executed by the same person who engraved the head-pieces
and other ornaments in Maittaire’s Latin Classics, printed for the same
publishers about nine years before; and there is reason to believe that
this person, as has been previously observed, was E.&nbsp;Kirkall.
Bewick, in the introduction prefixed to his “Fables of Æsop and others,”
first printed in 1818, says that the cuts in Croxall’s edition were “on
metal, in the manner of wood.” He, however, gives no reason for this
opinion, and I very much question its correctness. After a careful
inspection I have not been able to discover any peculiar mark which
should induce me to suppose that they had been engraved on metal; and
without some such mark indicating that the engraved surface had been
fastened to the block to raise it to the height of the type,
I&nbsp;consider it impossible for any person to decide merely from the
appearance of the impressions that those cuts were printed from a
metallic surface. The difference, in point of impression, between a
wood-cut and an engraving on type-metal in the same manner, or a cast in
type-metal from a wood-cut, is not to be distinguished. A&nbsp;wood
engraver of the present day, when casts
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page449" id = "page449">
449</a></span>
from wood-cuts are so frequently used instead of the original engraved
block, decides that a certain impression has been from a cast, not in
consequence of any peculiarity in its appearance denoting that it is
printed from a metallic surface, but from certain marks&mdash;little
flaws in the lines and minute “picks”&mdash;which he knows are
characteristic of a “cast.” When a cast, however, has been well taken,
and afterwards carefully cleared out with the graver, it is frequently
impossible to decide that the impression has been taken from it, unless
the examiner have also before him an impression from the original block
with which it may be compared; and even then, a&nbsp;person not very
well acquainted with the practice of wood engraving and the method of
taking casts from engraved wood-blocks, will be extremely liable to
decide erroneously.</p>

<p>Though it is by no means improbable that a person like Kirkall, who
had been accustomed to engrave on copper, might attempt to engrave on
type-metal in the same manner as on wood, and that he might thus execute
a few small head-pieces and flowered ornaments, yet I consider it very
unlikely that he should <i>continue to prefer metal</i> for the purpose
of relief engraving after he had made a few experiments. The advantages
of wood over type-metal are indeed so great, both as regards clearness
of line and facility of execution, that it seems incredible that any
person who had tried both materials should hesitate to give the
preference to wood. If, however, the cuts in Croxall’s Æsop were really
engraved on metal in the manner of wood, they are, as a series, the most
extraordinary specimens of relief engraving for the purpose of printing,
that have ever been executed. When Bewick stated that those cuts were
engraved on metal, I&nbsp;am inclined to think that he founded his
opinion rather on popular report than on close and impartial examination
of the cuts themselves; and it is further to be observed that Thomas
Bewick, with all his merits as a wood engraver, was not without his
weaknesses as a man; he was not unwilling that people should believe
that the art of wood engraving was lost in this country, and that the
honour of its re-discovery, as well as of its subsequent advancement,
was due to him. Though he was no doubt sincere in the opinion which he
gave, yet those who know him are well aware that he would not have felt
any pleasure in calling the attention of his readers to a series of
wood-cuts executed in England upwards of thirty years before he was
born, and which are not much inferior&mdash;except as regards the
animals&mdash;to the cuts of fables engraved by himself and his brother
previous to 1780.<a class = "tag" name = "tagVII4" id = "tagVII4" href =
"#noteVII4">VII.4</a> The cuts in Croxall’s Æsop not only
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page450" id = "page450">
450</a></span>
display great improvement in the engraver, supposing him to be the same
person that executed the head-pieces and ornaments in Maittaire’s Latin
Classics printed in 1713, but are very much superior to any cuts
contained in works of the same kind printed in France between 1700 and
1760.<a class = "tag" name = "tagVII5" id = "tagVII5" href =

<p>Many of the subjects in Croxall are merely reversed copies of
engravings on copper by S.&nbsp;Le Clerc, illustrative of a French
edition
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page451" id = "page451">
451</a></span>
of Æsop’s Fables published about 1694. The first of the preceding cuts
is a fac-simile of one of Le Clerc’s engravings; and the second is a
copy of the same subject as it appears in Croxall. The fable to which
they both relate is the Fox and the Goat.</p>

<p class = "illustration">

<p>The above cut is by no means one of the best in Croxall: it has not
been selected as a specimen of the manner in which those cuts are
executed, but as an instance of the closeness with which the English
wood-cuts have been copied from the French copper-plates. In several of
the cuts in Bewick’s Fables of Æsop and others, the arrangement and
composition appear to have been suggested by those in Croxall; but in
every instance of this kind the modern artist has made the subject his
own by the superior manner in which it is treated: he restores to the
animals their proper forms, represents them <i>acting</i> their parts as
described in the fable, and frequently introduces an incident or sketch
of landscape which gives to the whole subject a natural character. The
following copy of the Fox and Goat, in the Fables of Æsop and others,
1818-1823, will serve to show how little the modern artist has borrowed
in such instances from the cuts in Croxall, and how much has been
supplied by himself.</p>

<p>Between 1722 and 1724, Kirkall published by subscription twelve
chiaro-scuros engraved by himself, chiefly after designs by old Italian
masters. In those chiaro-scuros the outlines and the darker parts of the
figures are printed from copper-plates, and the sepia-coloured tints
afterwards impressed from wood-blocks; though they possess considerable
merit, they are deficient in spirit, and will not bear a comparison with
the chiaro-scuros executed by Ugo da Carpi and other early
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page452" id = "page452">
452</a></span>
Italian wood engravers. Most of them are too smooth, and want the bold
outline and vigorous character which distinguish the old chiaro-scuros:
what Kirkall gained in delicacy and precision by the introduction of
mezzotint, he lost through the inefficient engraving of the wood-blocks.
One of the largest of those chiaro-scuros is a copy of one of Ugo da
Carpi’s&mdash;Æneas carrying his father on his shoulders&mdash;after a
design by Raffaele. In Walpole’s Catalogue of Engravers, a&nbsp;notice
of Kirkall’s “new method of printing, composed of etching, mezzotinto,
and wooden stamps,” concludes with the following passage: “He performed
several prints in this manner, and did great justice to the drawing and
expression of the masters he imitated. This invention, for one may call
it so, had much success, much applause, no imitators.&mdash;I suppose it
is too laborious and too tedious. In an opulent country where there is
great facility of getting money, it is seldom got by merit. Our artists
are in too much hurry to gain it, or deserve it.”</p>

<p>About 1724 Kirkall published seventeen views of shipping, from
designs by W.&nbsp;Vandevelde, which he also called “prints in
chiaro-scuro.” They have, however, no just pretensions to the name as it
is usually understood when applied to prints, for they are merely tinted
engravings worked off in a greenish-blue ink. These so-called
chiaro-scuros are decided failures.</p>

<p>Kirkall engraved, on copper, the plates in Rowe’s translation of
Lucan’s Pharsalia, folio, published by Tonson, 1718; the plates for an
edition of Inigo Jones’s Stonehenge, 1725; and a frontispiece to the
works of Mrs. Eliza Haywood, which is thus alluded to in the
Dunciad:</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p class = "open">“See in the circle next Eliza placed,</p>
<p>Two babes of love close clinging to her waist;</p>
<p>Fair as before her works she stands confest,</p>
<p>In flowers and pearls by bounteous Kirkall drest.”</p>
</div>

<p>A considerable number of rude and tasteless ornaments and
head-pieces, with the mark F.&nbsp;H., engraved on wood, are to be found
in English books printed between 1720 and 1740. Several of them have
been cast in type-metal,<a class = "tag" name = "tagVII6" id = "tagVII6"
href = "#noteVII6">VII.6</a> as is evident from the marks of the pins,
in the impressions, by which they have been fastened to the blocks; the
same head-piece or ornament is also frequently found in books printed in
the same year by different printers. Some of the best headings and
tail-pieces of this period occur in a volume of “Miscellaneous Poems,
original and translated, by several hands. Published
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page453" id = "page453">
453</a></span>
by Mr. Concanen,” London, printed for J.&nbsp;Peele, octavo, 1724. The
subjects are, Apollo with a lyre; Minerva with a spear and shield; two
men sifting corn; Hercules destroying the hydra; and a man with a large
lantern. They are much superior to any cuts of the same kind with the
mark F.&nbsp;H.; and from the manner in which they are executed,
I&nbsp;am inclined to think that they are the work of the person who
engraved the cuts in Croxall’s Æsop. The following is a fac-simile of
one of the best of the cuts that I have ever seen with the mark
F.&nbsp;H. It occurs as a tail-piece at the end of the preface to
“Strephon’s Revenge: A&nbsp;Satire on the Oxford Toasts,” octavo,
London, 1724.<a class = "tag" name = "tagVII7" id = "tagVII7" href =

<p>John Baptist Jackson, an English wood engraver, was, according to
Papillon, a&nbsp;pupil of the person who engraved the small head-pieces
and ornaments in Maittaire’s Latin Classics, published by Tonson and
Watts in 1713; and as the cuts in Croxall’s Æsop were probably engraved
by the same person, as has been previously observed, it is not unlikely
that Jackson, as his apprentice, might have some share in their
execution. Though these cuts were much superior to any that had appeared
in England for about a hundred years previously, wood engraving seems to
have received but little encouragement. Probably from want of employment
in his own country, Jackson proceeded to Paris, where he remained
several years, chiefly employed in engraving head-pieces and ornaments
for the booksellers. Papillon, who seems to have borne no good-will
towards Jackson, thus speaks of him in the first volume of his “Traité
de la Gravure en Bois.”</p>

<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page454" id = "page454">

<p>“J. Jackson, an Englishman, who resided several years in Paris, might
have perfected himself in wood engraving, which he had learnt of an
English painter, as I have previously mentioned, if he had been willing
to follow the advice which it was in my power to give him. Having called
on me, as soon as he arrived in Paris, to ask for work, I&nbsp;for
several months gave him a few things to execute in order to afford him
the means of subsistence. He, however, repaid me with ingratitude; he
made a duplicate of a flowered ornament of my drawing, which he offered,
before delivering to me the block, to the person for whom it was to be
engraved. From the reproaches that I received, on the matter being
discovered, I&nbsp;naturally declined to employ him any longer. He then
went the round of the printing-offices in Paris, and was obliged to
engrave his cuts without order, and to offer them for almost nothing;
and many of the printers, profiting by his distress, supplied themselves
amply with his cuts. He had acquired a certain insipid taste which was
not above the little mosaics on snuff-boxes; and with ornaments of this
kind, after the manner of several other inferior engravers, he
surcharged his works. His mosaics, however delicately engraved, are
always deficient in effect, and display the engraver’s patience rather
than his talent; for the other parts of the cut, consisting of delicate
lines without tints or a gradation of light and shade, want that force
which is necessary to render the whole striking. Such wood engravings,
however deficient in this respect, are yet admired by printers of vulgar
taste, who foolishly pretend that they most resemble copper-plates, and
that they print better than cuts of a picturesque character, and
containing a variety of tints.</p>

<p>“Jackson, being obliged, through destitution, to leave Paris, where
he could get nothing more to do, travelled in France; and afterwards,
being disgusted with his profession, he accompanied a painter to Rome,
from whence he went to Venice, where, as I am informed, he married, and
subsequently returned to England, his native country.”<a class = "tag"
name = "tagVII8" id = "tagVII8" href = "#noteVII8">VII.8</a></p>

<p>Though Papillon speaks disparagingly of Jackson, the latter was at
least as good an engraver as himself. Jackson appears to have visited
Paris not later than 1726, for Papillon mentions a vignette and a large
letter engraved by him in that year for a Latin and French dictionary,
printed in 1727 by the brothers Barbou; and it is likely that he
remained there till about 1731. In an Italian translation of the Lives
of the Twelve Cæsars, printed there in quarto 1738, there is a large
ornamental title-page of his engraving; and in the same year he engraved
a chiaro-scuro of Christ taken down from the cross, from a
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page455" id = "page455">
455</a></span>
painting by Rembrandt,<a class = "tag" name = "tagVII9" id = "tagVII9"
href = "#noteVII9">VII.9</a> in the possession of Joseph Smith, Esq. the
British consul at Venice, a&nbsp;well-known collector of pictures and
other works of art. Between 1738 and 1742, when residing at Venice, he
also engraved twenty-seven large chiaro-scuros,&mdash;chiefly after
pictures by Titian, G.&nbsp;Bassano, Tintoret, and
P.&nbsp;Veronese,&mdash;which were published in a large folio volume in
the latter year. They are very unequal in point of merit; some of them
appearing harsh and crude, and others flat and spiritless, when compared
with similar productions of the old Italian wood engravers. One of the
best is the Martyrdom of St. Peter Dominicanus, after Titian, with the
date 1739; the manner in which the foliage of the trees is represented
is particularly good. On his return to England he seems to have totally
abandoned the practice of wood engraving in the ordinary manner for the
purpose of illustrating or ornamenting books; for I have not been able
to discover any English wood-cut of the period that either contains his
mark, or seems, from its comparative excellence, to have been of his
engraving. Finding no demand in this country for wood-cuts, he appears
to have tried to render his knowledge of engraving in chiaro-scuro
available for the purpose of printing paper-hangings. In an “Essay on
the Invention of Engraving and Printing in Chiaro Oscuro,”<a class =
"tag" name = "tagVII10" id = "tagVII10" href = "#noteVII10">VII.10</a>
published in his name in 1754, we learn that he was then engaged in a
manufacture of this kind at Battersea. The account given in this essay
of the origin and progress of chiaro-scuro engraving is frequently
incorrect; and from several of the statements which it contains, it
would seem that the writer was very imperfectly acquainted with the
works of his predecessors and contemporaries in the same department of
wood engraving. From the following passage, which is to be found in the
fifth page, it is evident that the writer was either ignorant of what
had been done in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and even in
his own age, or that he was wishful to enhance the merit of Mr.
Jackson’s process by concealing what had recently been done in the same
manner by others. “After having said all this, it may seem highly
improper to give to Mr. Jackson the merit of inventing this art; but let
me be permitted to say, that an art recovered is less little than an art
invented. The works of the former artists remain indeed; but the manner
in which they were done is entirely lost: the inventing then the manner
is really due to this latter undertaker, since no writings, or other
remains, are to be found by
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page456" id = "page456">
456</a></span>
which the method of former artists can be discovered, or in what manner
they executed their works; nor, in truth, has the Italian method since
the beginning of the sixteenth century been attempted by any one except
Mr. Jackson.” What is here called the “Italian method,” that is, the
method of executing chiaro-scuros entirely on wood, was practised in
France at the end of the seventeenth century: and Nicholas Le Sueur had
engraved several cuts in this manner about 1730, the very time when
Jackson was living in Paris. The principles of the art had also been
applied in France to the execution of paper-hangings upwards of fifty
years before Jackson attempted to establish the same kind of manufacture
in England. Not a word is said of the chiaro-scuros of Kirkall,<a class
= "tag" name = "tagVII11" id = "tagVII11" href = "#noteVII11">VII.11</a>
from whom it is likely that Jackson first acquired his knowledge of
chiaro-scuro engraving: with the exception of the outlines and some
other parts in these chiaro-scuros being executed in mezzotint, the
printing of the rest from wood-blocks is precisely the same as in the
Italian method.</p>

<p>The Essay contains eight prints illustrative of Mr. Jackson’s method;
four are chiaro-scuros, and four are printed in “proper colours,” as is
expressed in the title, in imitation of drawings. They are very poorly
executed, and are very much inferior to the chiaro-scuros engraved by
Jackson when residing at Venice. The prints in “proper colours” are
egregious failures. The following notices respecting Mr. Jackson are
extracted from the Essay in question.</p>

<p>“Certainly Mr. Jackson, the person of whom we speak, has not spent
less time and pains, applied less assiduity, or travelled to fewer
distant countries in search of perfecting his art, than other men;
having passed twenty years in France and Italy to complete himself in
drawing after the best masters in the best schools, and to see what
antiquity had most worthy the attention of a student in his particular
pursuits. After all this time spent in perfecting himself in his
discoveries, like a true lover of his native country, he is returned
with a design to communicate all the means which his endeavours can
contribute to enrich the land where he drew his first breath, by adding
to its commerce, and employing its inhabitants; and yet, like a citizen
of it, he would willingly enjoy some little share of those advantages
before he leaves this world, which he must leave behind him to his
countrymen when he shall be no more.”</p>

<p>“During his residence at Venice, where he made himself perfect
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page457" id = "page457">
457</a></span>
in the art which he professes, he finished many works well known to the
nobility and gentry who travelled to that city whilst he lived in
it.&mdash;Mr. Frederick, Mr. Lethuillier, and Mr. Smith, the English
consul at Venice, encouraged Mr. Jackson to undertake to engrave in
chiaro-oscuro, blocks after the most capital pictures of Titian,
Tintoret, Giacomo Bassano, and Paul Veronese, which are to be found in
Venice, and to this end procured him a subscription. In this work may be
seen what engraving on wood will effectuate, and how truly the spirit
and genius of every one of those celebrated masters are preserved in the
prints.</p>

<p>“During his executing this work he was honoured with the
encouragement of the Right Honourable the Marquis of Hartington, Sir
Roger Newdigate, Sir Bouchier Wrey, and other English gentlemen on their
travels at Venice, who saw Mr. Jackson drawing on the blocks for the
print after the famous picture of the Crucifixion painted by Tintoret in
the albergo of St. Roche. Those prints may now be seen at his house at
Battersea.&mdash;Not content with having brought his works in
chiaro-oscuro to such perfection, he attempted to print landscapes in
all their original colours; not only to give to the world all the
outline light and shade, which is to be found in the paintings of the
best masters, but in a great degree their very manner and taste of
colouring. With this intent he published six landscapes,<a class = "tag"
name = "tagVII12" id = "tagVII12" href = "#noteVII12">VII.12</a> which
are his first attempt in this nature, in imitation of painting in
<i>aquarillo</i> or water-colours; which work was taken notice of by the
Earl of Holderness, then ambassador extraordinary to the republic of
Venice; and his excellency was pleased to permit the dedication of those
prints to him, and to encourage this new attempt of printing pictures
with a very particular and very favourable regard, and to express his
approbation of the merit of the inventor.”</p>

<p>John Michael Papillon, one of the best French wood engravers of his
age, was born in 1698. His grandfather and his father, as has been
previously observed, were both wood engravers. In 1706, when only eight
years old, he secretly made his first essay in wood engraving; and when
only nine, his father, who had become aware of his amusing himself in
this manner, gave him a large block to engrave, which he appears to have
executed to his father’s satisfaction, though he had previously received
no instructions in the art.<a class = "tag" name = "tagVII13" id =
"tagVII13" href = "#noteVII13">VII.13</a> The block was intended
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page458" id = "page458">
458</a></span>
for printing paper-hangings, the manufacture of which was his father’s
principal business. Though until the time of his father’s death, which
happened in 1723, Papillon appears to have been chiefly employed in such
works, and in hanging the papers which he had previously engraved, he
yet executed several vignettes and ornaments for the booksellers, and
sedulously endeavoured to improve himself in this higher department of
his business.</p>

<p>Shortly after the death of his father he married; and, having given
up the business of engraving paper-hangings, he laboured so hard to
perfect himself in the art of designing and engraving vignettes and
ornaments for books, that his head became affected; and he sometimes
displayed such absence of mind that his wife became alarmed, fancying
that “he no longer loved her.” On his assuring her that his behaviour
was the result of his anxiety to improve himself in drawing and
engraving on wood, and to write something about the art, she encouraged
him in his purpose, and aided him with her advice, for, as she was the
daughter of a clever man, M.&nbsp;Chaveau, a&nbsp;sculptor, and had
herself made many pretty drawings on fans, she had some knowledge of
design. Papillon’s fits of absence, however, though they may have been
proximately induced by close application and anxiety about his success
in the line to which he intended to apply himself in future, appear to
have originated in a tendency to insanity, which at a later period
displayed itself in a more decided manner. In 1759, in consequence of a
determination of blood to the head, as he says, through excessive joy at
seeing his only daughter, who had lived from the age of four years with
her uncle, combined with a recollection of his former sorrows, his mind
became so much disordered that it was necessary to send him to an
hospital, where, through repeated bleedings and other remedies, he seems
to have speedily recovered. He mentions that in the same year, four
other engravers were attacked by the same malady, and that only one of
them regained his senses.<a class = "tag" name = "tagVII14" id =
"tagVII14" href = "#noteVII14">VII.14</a></p>

<p>Papillon’s endeavours to improve himself were not unsuccessful; the
cuts which he engraved about 1724, though mostly small, possess
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page459" id = "page459">
459</a></span>
considerable merit; they are not only designed with much more feeling
than the generality of those executed by other French engravers of the
period, but are also much more effective, displaying a variety of tint
and a contrast of light and shade which are not to be found in the works
of his contemporaries. In 1726, in order to divert his anxiety and to
bring his cuts into notice, he projected <i>Le petit Almanach de
Paris</i>, which subsequently was generally known as “Le Papillon.” The
first that he published was for the year 1727; and the wood-cuts which
it contained equally attracted the attention of the public and of
connoisseurs. Monsieur Colombat, the editor of the Court Calendar, spoke
highly of the cut for the mouth of January; the cross-hatchings, he
said, were executed in the first style of wood engraving, and he kindly
predicted to Papillon that he would one day excel in his art. From this
time he seems to have no longer had any doubt of his own abilities, but,
on the contrary, to have entertained a very high opinion of them. He
appears to have considered wood engraving as the highest of all the
graphic arts, and himself as the greatest of all its professors, either
ancient or modern.</p>

<p>From this, to him, memorable epoch,&mdash;the publication of “Le
petit Almanach de Paris,” with cuts by <span class =
"smallcaps">Papillon</span>,&mdash;he appears to have been seldom
without employment, for in the Supplement to the “Traité de la Gravure
en Bois,” he mentions that in 1768, the “Collection of the Works of the
Papillons,” presented by him to the Royal Library, contained upwards of
<i>five thousand</i> pieces of his own engraving. This “Recueil des
Papillons,” which he seems to have considered as a family monument “ære
perennius,” is perpetually referred to in the course of his work. It
consisted of four large folio volumes containing specimens of wood
engravings executed by the different members of the Papillon family for
three generations&mdash;his grandfather, his father, his uncle, his
brother, and himself.</p>

<p>Papillon was employed not only by the booksellers of his own country,
but also by those of Holland. A&nbsp;book, entitled “Historische School
en Huis-Bybel,” printed at Amsterdam in 1743, contains two hundred and
seventeen cuts, all of which appear to have been either engraved by
Papillon himself, or under his superintendence. His name appears on
several of them, and they are all engraved in the same style. From a
passage in the dedication, it seems likely that they had appeared in a
similar work printed at the same place a few years previously. They are
generally executed in a coarser manner than those contained in
Papillon’s own work, but the style of engraving and general effect are
the same. The cut on the next page is a copy of the first, which is one
of the best in the work. To the left is
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page460" id = "page460">

Papillon’s name, engraved, as was customary with him, in very small
letters, with the date, 1734.</p>

<p>Papillon’s History of Wood Engraving, published in 1766, in two
octavo volumes, with a Supplement,<a class = "tag" name = "tagVII15" id
= "tagVII15" href = "#noteVII15">VII.15</a> under the title of “Traité
Historique et Pratique de la Gravure en Bois,” is said to have been
projected, and partly written, upwards of thirty years before it was
given to the public. Shortly after his being admitted a member of the
Society of Arts, in 1733, he read, at one of the meetings, a&nbsp;paper
on the history and practice of wood engraving; and in 1735 the Society
signified their approbation that a work written by him on the subject
should be printed. It appears that the first volume of such a work was
actually printed between 1736 and 1738, but never published. He does not
explain why the work was not proceeded with at that time; and it would
be useless to speculate on the possible causes of the interruption. He
mentions that a copy of this volume was preserved in the Royal Library;
and he charges Fournier the younger, who between 1758 and 1761 published
three tracts on the invention of wood engraving and printing, with
having availed himself of a portion of the historical information
contained in this volume. The public, however, according to his own
statement, gained by the delay; as he grew older he gained more
knowledge of the history of the art, and “invented” several important
improvements in his practice, all of which are embodied in his later
work. In 1758 he also discovered the memoranda which he had made at
Monsieur De Greder’s, in 1719 or 1720, relative to the interesting
twins,
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page461" id = "page461">
461</a></span>
Alexander Alberic Cunio and his sister Isabella, who, about 1284,
between the fourteenth and sixteenth years of their age, executed a
series of wood engravings illustrative of the history of Alexander the
Great.<a class = "tag" name = "tagVII16" id = "tagVII16" href =
"#noteVII16">VII.16</a> However the reader may be delighted or amused by
the romantic narrative of the Cunio, Papillon’s reputation as the
historian of his art would most likely have stood a <i>little</i> higher
had he never discovered those memoranda. They have very much the
character of ill-contrived forgeries; and even supposing that he
believed them, and printed them in good faith, his judgment must be
sacrificed to save his honesty.</p>

<p>The first volume of Papillon’s work contains the history of the art;
it is divided into two parts, the first treating of wood engraving for
the purpose of printing in the usual manner from a single block, and the
second treating of chiaro-scuro. He does not trace the progress of the
art by pointing out the improvements introduced at different periods; he
enumerates all the principal cuts that he had seen, without reference to
their execution as compared with those of an earlier date; and, from his
desire to enhance the importance of his art, he claims almost every
eminent painter whose name or mark is to be found on a cut, as a wood
engraver. He is in this respect so extremely credulous as to assert that
Mary de Medici, Queen of Henry IV. of France, had occasionally amused
herself with engraving on wood; and in order to place the fact beyond
doubt he refers to a cut representing the bust of a female, with the
following inscription: “<span class = "smallcaps">Maria Medici.
F.&nbsp;m.d.lxxxvii.</span>” “The engraving,” he observes, with his
usual <i>bonhomie</i>, “is rather better than what might be reasonably
expected from a person of such quality; it contains many
cross-hatchings, somewhat unequal indeed, and occasionally imperfect,
but, notwithstanding, sufficiently well engraved to show that she had
executed several wood-cuts before she had attempted this. I&nbsp;know
more than one wood engraver&mdash;or at least calling himself
such&mdash;who is incapable of doing the like.” In 1587, the date of
this cut, Mary de Medici was only fourteen years old; and since its
execution, according to Papillon, shows that she was then no novice in
the art, she must have acquired her practical knowledge of wood
engraving at rather an early age,&mdash;at least for a princess.
Papillon never seems to have considered that F is the first letter of
“<span class = "smallcaps">Filia</span>” as well as of “<span class =
"smallcaps">Fecit</span>,” nor to have suspected that the cut was simply
a portrait of Mary de Medici, and not a specimen of her engraving.</p>

<p>From the following passage in the preface, he seems to have been
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page462" id = "page462">
462</a></span>
aware that his including the names of many eminent painters in his list
of wood engravers would be objected to. “Some persons, who entertain a
preconceived opinion that many painters whom I mention have not engraved
on wood, may perhaps dispute the works which I ascribe to them. Of such
persons I have to request that they will not condemn me before they have
acquainted themselves with my researches and examined my proofs, and
that they will judge of them without prejudice or partiality.” The
“researches” to which he alludes, appear to have consisted in searching
out the names and marks of eminent painters in old wood-cuts, and his
“proofs” are of the same kind as that which he alleges in support of his
assertion that Mary de Medici had engraved on wood,&mdash;a fact which,
as he remarks, “was unknown to Rubens.” The historical portion of
Papillon’s work is indeed little more than a confused catalogue of all
the wood-cuts which had come under his observation; it abounds in
errors, and almost every page affords an instance of his credulity.</p>

<p>In the second volume, which is occupied with details relative to the
practice of the art, Papillon gives his instructions and enumerates his
“inventions” in a style of complacent self-conceit. The most trifling
remarks are accompanied by a reference to the “Recueil des Papillons;”
and the most obvious means of effecting certain objects,&mdash;such
means as had been regularly adopted by wood engravers for upwards of two
hundred years previously, and such as in succeeding times have suggested
themselves to persons who never received any instructions in the
art,&mdash;are spoken of as important discoveries, and credit taken for
them accordingly. One of his fancied discoveries is that of lowering the
surface of a block towards the edges in order that the engraved lines in
those parts may be less subject to the action of the <i>plattin</i> in
printing, and consequently lighter in the impression. The Lyons Dance of
Death, 1538, affords several instances of blocks lowered in this manner,
not only towards the edges, but also in the middle of the cut, whenever
it was necessary that certain delicately engraved lines should be
lightly printed, and thus have the appearance of gradually diminishing
till their extremities should scarcely be distinguishable from the paper
on which they are impressed. Numerous instances of this practice are
frequent in wood-cuts executed from 1540 to the decline of the art in
the seventeenth century. Lowering was also practised by the engraver of
the cuts in Croxall’s Æsop; by Thomas Bewick, who acquired a knowledge
of wood engraving without a master; and by the self-taught artist who
executed the cuts in Alexander’s Expedition down the Hydaspes,
a&nbsp;poem by Dr. Thomas Beddoes, printed in 1792, but never
published.<a class = "tag" name = "tagVII17" id = "tagVII17" href =
"#noteVII17">VII.17</a> As the
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page463" id = "page463">
463</a></span>
same practice has recently been claimed as an “invention,” it would seem
that some wood engravers are either apt to ascribe much importance to
little things, or are singularly ignorant of what has been done by their
predecessors. Such an “invention,” though unquestionably useful, surely
does not require any particular ingenuity for its discovery; such
“discoveries” every man makes for himself as soon as he feels the want
of that which the so-called invention will supply. The man who pares the
cork of a quart bottle in order to make it fit a smaller one is, with
equal justice, entitled to the name of an inventor, provided he was not
aware of the thing having been done before: such an “adaptation of means
to the end” cannot, however, be considered as an effort of genius
deserving of public commendation.</p>

<p>In Papillon’s time it was not customary with French engravers on wood
to have the subject perfectly drawn on the block, with all the lines and
hatchings pencilled in, and the <i>effect</i> and the different tints
indicated either in pencil or in Indian ink, as is the usual practice in
the present day. The design was first drawn on paper; from this, by
means of tracing paper, the engraver made an outline copy on the block;
and, without pencilling in all the lines or washing in the tints, he
proceeded to “translate” the original, to which he constantly referred
in the progress of his work, in the same manner as a copper-plate
engraver does to the drawing or painting before him. Papillon perceived
the disadvantages which resulted from this mode of proceeding; and
though he still continued to make his first drawing on paper, he copied
it more carefully and distinctly on the block than was usual with his
contemporaries. He was thus enabled to proceed with greater certainty in
his engraving; what he had to effect was immediately before him, and it
was no longer necessary to refer so frequently to the original. To the
circumstance of the drawings being perfectly made on the block, Papillon
ascribes in a great measure the excellence of the old wood engravings of
the time of Durer and Holbein.</p>

<p>Papillon, although always inclined to magnify little things connected
with wood engraving, and to take great credit to himself for trifling
“inventions,” was yet thoroughly acquainted with the practice of his
art. The mode of thickening the lines in certain parts of a cut, after
it has
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page464" id = "page464">
464</a></span>
been engraved, by scraping them down, was frequently practised by him,
and he explains the manner of proceeding, and gives a cut of the tools
required in the operation.<a class = "tag" name = "tagVII18" id =
"tagVII18" href = "#noteVII18">VII.18</a> As Papillon, previous to the
publication of his book, had contributed several papers on the subject
of wood engraving to the famed Encyclopédie, he avails himself of the
second volume of the Traité to propose several additions and corrections
to those articles. The following definition proposed to be inserted in
the Encyclopédie, after the article <span class =
"smallcaps">Gratuit</span>, will afford some idea of the manner in which
he is accustomed to speak of his “inventions.” The term which he
explains is “<span class = "smallcaps">Gratture</span> ou <span class =
"smallcaps">Grattage</span>,” literally, “<span class =
"smallcaps">Scraping</span>,” the practice just alluded to. “This is,
according to the new manner of engraving on wood, the operation of
skilfully and carefully scraping down parts in an engraved block which
are not sufficiently dark, in order to give them, as may be required,
greater strength, and to render the shades more effective. This
admirable plan, utterly unknown before, was accidentally discovered in
1731 by M.&nbsp;Papillon, by whom the art of wood engraving is advanced
to a state tending to perfection, and approaching more and more towards
the beauty of engraving on copper.” The tools used by Papillon to scrape
down the lines of an engraved block, and thus render them thicker and,
consequently, the impression darker, differ considerably in shape from
those used for the same purpose by modern wood engravers in England.
This tool now principally used is something like a copper-plate
engraver’s burnisher, and occasionally a fine and sharp file is
employed.</p>

<p>In Papillon’s time the French wood engravers appear to have held the
graver in the manner of a pen, and in forming a line to have cut
<i>towards them</i> as in forming a down-stroke in writing, and to have
engraved on the longitudinal, and not the cross section of the wood.
Modern English wood engravers, having the rounded handle of the graver
supported against the hollow of the hand, and directing the blade by
means of the fore-finger and thumb, cut the line <i>from them</i>; and
always engrave on the cross section of the wood. Papillon mentions box,
pear-tree, apple-tree, and the wood of the service-tree, as the best for
the purposes of engraving: box was generally used for the smaller and
finer cuts intended for the illustration or ornament of books; the
larger cuts, in which delicacy was not required, were mostly engraved on
pear-tree wood. Apple-tree wood was principally used by the wood
engravers of Normandy. Next to box, Papillon prefers the wood of the
service-tree. The box brought from Turkey, though of larger size, he
considers inferior to that of Provence, Italy, or Spain.</p>

<p>Although Papillon’s <i>modus operandi</i> differs considerably from
that of English wood engravers of the present day, I&nbsp;am not aware
of any supposed discovery in the modern practice of the art that was not
known to him. The methods of lowering a block in certain parts before
drawing the subject on it, and of thickening the lines, and thus getting
more <i>colour</i>, by scraping the surface of the cut when engraved,
were, as has been observed, known to him; he occasionally introduced
cross-hatchings in his cuts;<a class = "tag" name = "tagVII19" id =
"tagVII19" href = "#noteVII19">VII.19</a> and in one of his chapters he
gives instructions how to insert a <i>plug</i> in a block, in order to
replace a part which had either been spoiled in the course of engraving
or subsequently damaged. One of the improvements which he suggested, but
did not put in practice, was a plan for engraving the same subject on
two, three, or four blocks, in order to obtain cross-hatchings and a
variety of tints with less trouble than if the subject were entirely
engraved on the same block. Such cuts were not to be printed as
chiaro-scuros, but in the usual manner, with printer’s ink. It is worthy
of observation that Bewick in the latter part of his life had formed a
similar opinion of the advantages of engraving a subject on two or more
blocks, and thus obtaining with comparative ease such cross-lines and
varied tints as could only be executed with great difficulty on a single
block. He, however, proceeded further than Papillon, for he began to
engrave a large cut which he intended to finish in this manner; and he
was so satisfied that the experiment would be successful, that when the
pressman handed to him a proof of the first block, he exclaimed,
“I&nbsp;wish I was but twenty years younger!”</p>

<p>Papillon, in his account of the practice of the art, explains the
manner of engraving and printing chiaro-scuros; and in illustration of
the process he gives a cut executed in this style, together with
separate impressions from each of the four blocks from which it is
printed. There is also another cut of the same kind prefixed to the
second part of the first volume, containing the history of engraving in
chiaro-scuro. Scarcely anything connected with the practice of wood
engraving appears to have escaped his notice. He mentions the effect of
the breath in cold weather as rendering the block damp and the drawing
less distinct; and he gives in one of his cuts the figure of a
“mentonnière,”&mdash;that is to say, a&nbsp;piece of quilted linen, like
the pad used by women to keep their bonnets cocked up,&mdash;which,
being placed
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page466" id = "page466">
466</a></span>
before the mouth and nostrils, and kept in its place by strings tied
behind the head, screened the block from the direct action of the
engraver’s breath.</p>

<p>He frequently complains of the careless manner in which wood-cuts
were printed;<a class = "tag" name = "tagVII20" id = "tagVII20" href =
"#noteVII20">VII.20</a> but from the following passage we learn that the
inferiority of the printed cuts when compared with the engraver’s proofs
did not always proceed from the negligence of the printer. “Some wood
engravers have the art of fabricating proofs of their cuts much more
excellent and delicate than they fairly ought to be; and the following
is the manner in which they contrive to obtain tolerably decent proofs
from very indifferent engravings. They first take two or three
impressions, and then, to obtain one to their liking, and with which
they may deceive their employers, they only ink the block on those
places which ought to be dark, leaving the distances and lighter parts
without any ink, except what remained after taking the previous
impressions. The proof which they now obtain appears extremely delicate
in those parts which were not properly inked; but when they come to be
printed in a page with type, the impression is quite different from the
proof which the engraver delivers with the blocks; there is no variety
of tint, all is hard, and the distance is sometimes darker than objects
in the fore-ground. I&nbsp;run no great risk in saying that all the
three <i>Le Sueurs</i> have been accustomed to practise this
deception.”<a class = "tag" name = "tagVII21" id = "tagVII21" href =

<p>All the cuts in Papillon’s work, except the portrait prefixed to the
first volume,<a class = "tag" name = "tagVII22" id = "tagVII22" href =
"#noteVII22">VII.22</a> are his own engraving, and, for the most part,
from his own designs. The most of the blocks were lent to the author by
the different persons for whom he had engraved them long previous to the
appearance of his work.<a class = "tag" name = "tagVII23" id =
"tagVII23" href = "#noteVII23">VII.23</a> They are introduced as
ornaments at the beginning and end of the chapters; but though they may
enable the reader to judge of Papillon’s abilities as a designer and
engraver on wood, beyond this they do not in the least illustrate the
progress of the art.
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page467" id = "page467">
467</a></span>
The execution of some of the best is extremely neat; and almost all of
them display an effect&mdash;a contrast of black and white&mdash;which
is not to be found in any other wood-cuts of the period. A&nbsp;few of
the designs possess considerable merit, but in by far the greater number
simplicity and truth are sacrificed to ornament and French taste.
Whatever may be Papillon’s faults as a historian of the art, he deserves
great credit for the diligence with which he pursued it under
unfavourable circumstances, and for his endeavours to bring it into
notice at a time when it was greatly neglected. His labours in this
respect were, however, attended with no immediate fruit. He died in
1776, and his immediate successors do not appear to have profited by his
instructions. The wood-cuts executed in France between 1776 and 1815 are
generally much inferior to those of Papillon; and the recent progress
which wood engraving has made in that country seems rather to have been
influenced by English example than by his precepts.</p>

<p>Nicholas Le Sueur&mdash;born 1691, died 1764,&mdash;was, next to
Papillon, the best French wood engraver of his time. His chiaro-scuros,
printed entirely from wood-blocks, are executed with great boldness and
spirit, and partake more of the character of the earlier Italian
chiaro-scuros than any other works of the same kind engraved by his
contemporaries.<a class = "tag" name = "tagVII24" id = "tagVII24" href =
"#noteVII24">VII.24</a> He chiefly excelled in the execution of
chiaro-scuros and large cuts; his small cuts are of very ordinary
character; they are generally engraved in a hard and meagre style, want
variety of tint, and are deficient in effect.</p>

<p>P. S. Fournier, the younger, a letter-founder of considerable
reputation,&mdash;born at Paris 1712, died 1768,&mdash;occasionally
engraved on wood. Papillon says that he was self-taught; and that he
certainly would have made greater progress in the art had he not devoted
himself almost exclusively to the business of type-founding. Monsieur
Fournier is, however, better known as a writer on the history of the art
than as a practical wood engraver. Between 1758 and 1761 he published
three tracts relating to the origin and progress of wood engraving, and
the invention of typography.<a class = "tag" name = "tagVII25" id =
"tagVII25" href = "#noteVII25">VII.25</a> From these works it is evident
that, though
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page468" id = "page468">
468</a></span>
he takes no small credit to himself for his practical knowledge of wood
engraving and printing, he was very imperfectly acquainted with his
subject. They abound in errors which it is impossible that any person
possessing the knowledge he boasts of should commit, unless he had very
superficially examined the books and cuts on which he pronounces an
opinion. He seems indeed to have thought that, from the circumstance of
his being a wood engraver and letter-founder, his decisions on all
doubtful matters in the early history of wood engraving and printing
should be received with implicit faith. Looking at the comparatively
small size of his works, no writer, not even Papillon himself, has
committed so many mistakes; and his decisions are generally most
peremptory when utterly groundless or evidently wrong. He asserts that
Faust and Scheffer’s Psalter, 1457-1459, is printed from moveable types
of wood, and that the most of the earliest specimens of typography are
printed from the same kind of types; and in the fulness of his knowledge
he also declares that the text of the Theurdank is printed not from
types, but from engraved wood-blocks. Like Papillon, he seems to have
possessed a marvellous sagacity in ferreting out old wood engravers. He
says that Andrea Mantegna engraved on wood a grand triumph in 1486; that
Sebastian Brandt engraved in 1490 the wood-cuts in the Ship of Fools,<a
class = "tag" name = "tagVII26" id = "tagVII26" href =
"#noteVII26">VII.26</a> after the designs of J.&nbsp;Locher; and that
Parmegiano
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page469" id = "page469">
469</a></span>
executed several wood-cuts after designs by Raffaele. He decides
positively that Albert Durer, Lucas Cranach, Titian, and Holbein were
wood engravers, and, like Papillon, he includes Mary de Medici in the
list. Papillon appears to have had good reason to complain that Fournier
had availed himself of his volume printed in 1738. His taste appears to
have been scarcely superior to his knowledge and judgment: he mentions a
large and coarsely engraved cut of the head of Christ as one of the best
specimens of Albert Durer’s engraving; and he says that Papillon’s cuts
are for excellence of design and execution equal to those of the
greatest masters!</p>

<p>From a passage in one of Fournier’s tracts&mdash;Remarques
Typographiques, 1761,&mdash;it is evident that wood engraving was then
greatly neglected in Germany. It relates to the following observation of
M.&nbsp;Bär’s, almoner of the Swedish chapel at Paris, on the length of
time necessary to engrave a number of wooden types sufficient to print
such a work as Faust and Scheffer’s Psalter: “M.&nbsp;Schœpflin declares
that, by the general admission of all experienced persons, it would
require upwards of six years to complete such a work in so perfect a
manner.” The following is Fournier’s rejoinder: “To understand the value
of this remark, it ought to be known that, so far from there being many
experienced wood engravers to choose from, M.&nbsp;Schœpflin would most
likely experience some difficulty in finding one to consult.” The
wood-cuts which occur in German books printed between 1700 and 1760 are
certainly of the most wretched kind; contemptible alike in design and
execution. Some of the best which I have seen&mdash;and they are very
bad&mdash;are to be found in a thin folio entitled “Orbis Literatus
Germanico-Europaeus,” printed at Frankfort in 1737. They are cuts of the
seals of all the principal colleges and academical foundations in
Germany. The art in Italy about the same period was almost equally
neglected. An Italian wood engraver, named Lucchesini, executed several
cuts between 1760 and 1770. Most of the head-pieces and ornaments in the
Popes’ Decretals, printed at Rome at this period, were engraved by him;
and he also engraved the cuts in a Spanish book entitled “Letania
Lauretana de la Virgen Santissima,” printed at Valencia in 1768. It is
scarcely necessary to say that these cuts are of the humblest
character.</p>

<p>Though wood engraving did not make any progress in England from 1722
to the time of Thomas Bewick, yet the art was certainly never lost in
this country; the old stock still continued to put forth a
branch&mdash;<i>non deficit alter</i>&mdash;although not a golden one.
Two wood-cuts tolerably well executed, and which show that the engraver
was acquainted with the practice of “lowering,” occur in a thin quarto,
London, printed for H.&nbsp;Payne, 1760. The book and the cuts are thus
noticed in Southey’s Life
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page470" id = "page470">

of Cowper, volume&nbsp;<span class = "smallroman">I.</span> page 50. The

there can be little doubt that the two odes to Obscurity and Oblivion
originated, joint compositions of Lloyd and Colman, in ridicule of Gray
and Mason. They were published in a quarto pamphlet, with a vignette, in
the title-page, of an ancient poet safely seated and playing on his
harp; and at the end a tail-piece representing a modern poet in huge
boots, flung from a mountain by his Pegasus into the sea, and losing his
tie-wig in the fall.” The following is a fac-simile of the cut
representing the poet’s fall. He seems to have been tolerably confident
of himself, for, though the winged steed has no bridle, he is provided
with a pair of formidable spurs.</p>

<p>The cuts in a collection of humorous pieces in verse, entitled “The
Oxford Sausage,” 1764, are evidently by the same engraver, and almost
every one of them affords an instance of “lowering.” At the foot of one
of them, at page 89, the name “Lister” is seen; the subject is a
bacchanalian figure mounted on a winged horse, which has undoubtedly
been drawn from the same model as the Pegasus in Colman and Lloyd’s
burlesque odes. In an edition of the
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page471" id = "page471">
471</a></span>
Sausage, printed in 1772, the name of “T.&nbsp;Lister” occurs on the
title-page as one of the publishers, and as residing at Oxford. Although
those cuts are generally deficient in effect, their execution is
scarcely inferior to many of those in the work of Papillon; the portrait
indeed of “Mrs. Dorothy Spreadbury, Inventress of the Oxford Sausage,”
forming the frontispiece to the edition of 1772, is better executed than
Monsieur Nicholas Caron’s votive portrait of Papillon, “the restorer of
the art of wood engraving.”</p>

<p>In 1763, a person named S. Watts engraved two or three large
wood-cuts in outline, slightly shaded, after drawings by Luca Cambiaso.
Impressions of those cuts are most frequently printed in a yellowish
kind of ink. About the same time Watts also engraved, in a bold and free
style, several small circular portraits of painters. In Sir John
Hawkins’s History of Music, published in 1776, there are four wood-cuts;
and at the bottom of the largest&mdash;Palestrini presenting his work on
Music to the Pope&mdash;is the name of the engraver thus:
<i>T.&nbsp;Hodgson. Sculp.</i> Dr. Dibdin, in noticing this cut, in his
Preliminary Disquisition on Early Engraving and Ornamental Printing,
prefixed to his edition of the Typographical Antiquities, says that it
was “done by Hodgson, the master of the celebrated Bewick.”<a class =
"tag" name = "tagVII27" id = "tagVII27" href = "#noteVII27">VII.27</a>
If by this it is meant that Bewick was the apprentice of Hodgson, or
that he obtained from Hodgson his knowledge of wood engraving, the
assertion is incorrect. It is, however, almost certain that Bewick, when
in London in 1776, was employed by Hodgson, as will be shown in its
proper place.</p>

<p>Having now given some account of wood engraving in its languishing
state&mdash;occasionally showing symptoms of returning vigour, and then
almost immediately sinking into its former state of depression&mdash;we
at length arrive at an epoch from which its revival and progressive
improvement may be safely dated. The person whose productions recalled
public attention to the neglected art of wood engraving was</p>

<p>This distinguished wood engraver, whose works will be admired as long
as truth and nature shall continue to charm, was born on the 10th or
11th of August, 1753, at Cherry-burn, in the county of Northumberland,
but on the south side of the Tyne, about twelve miles westward of
Newcastle.</p>

THE HOUSE IN WHICH BEWICK WAS BORN.</p>

<p>His father rented a small land-sale colliery at Mickley-bank, in the
neighbourhood of his dwelling, and it is said that when a boy the future
wood engraver sometimes worked in the pit. At a proper age he was sent
as a day-scholar to a school kept by the Rev. Christopher Gregson at
Ovingham, on the opposite side of the Tyne. The Parsonage House, in
which Mr. Gregson lived, is pleasantly situated on the edge of a sloping
bank immediately above the river; and many reminiscences of the place
are to be found in Bewick’s cuts; the gate at the entrance is
introduced, with trifling variations, in three or four different
subjects; and a person acquainted with the neighbourhood will easily
recognise in his tail-pieces several other little local sketches of a
similar kind. In the time of the Rev. James Birkett, Mr. Gregson’s
successor, Ovingham school had the character of being one of the best
private schools in the county; and several gentlemen, whose talents
reflect credit on their teacher, received their education there. In the
following cut, representing a view of Ovingham from the south-westward,
the Parsonage House, with its garden sloping down to the Tyne, is
perceived immediately to the right of the clump of large trees. The bank
on which those trees grow is known as the
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page473" id = "page473">

<i>crow-tree bank</i>. The following lines, descriptive of a view from
the Parsonage House, are from “The School Boy,” a&nbsp;poem, by Thomas
Maude, A.M., who received his early education at Ovingham under Mr.
Birkett.</p>

Latin, he does not appear to have ever received any instructions in that
language. In a letter dated 18th April, 1803, addressed to Mr.
Christopher Gregson,<a class = "tag" name = "tagVII28" id = "tagVII28"
href = "#noteVII28">VII.28</a> London, a&nbsp;son of his old master,
introducing an artist of the name of Murphy, who had painted his
portrait, Bewick humorously alludes to his <i>beauty</i> when a boy, and
to the state of his coat-sleeve, in consequence of his using it instead
of a pocket-handkerchief. Bewick, it is to be observed, was very
hard-featured, and much marked with the small-pox. After mentioning Mr.
Murphy as “a&nbsp;man of worth, and a first-rate artist in the miniature
line,” he thus proceeds: “I&nbsp;do not imagine, at your time of life,
my dear friend, that you will be solicitous about forming new
acquaintances; but it may not, perhaps, be putting you much out of the
way to show any little civilities to Mr. Murphy during his stay in
London. He has, on his own account, taken my portrait, and I dare say
will be desirous to show you it the first opportunity: when you see it,
you will no doubt conclude that T.&nbsp;B. is turning <i>bonnyer</i> and

its turning out so <i>long since</i>. But if you have forgot our
earliest youth, perhaps your brother P.<a class = "tag" name =

to remember what a <i>great beauty</i> I was at that time, when the grey
coat-sleeve was <i>glazed</i> from the cuff towards the elbows.” The
words printed in Italics are those that are underlined by Bewick
himself.</p>

<p>Bewick, having shown a taste for drawing, was placed by his father as
an apprentice with Mr. Ralph Beilby, an engraver, living in Newcastle,
to whom on the 1st of October 1767 he was bound for a term of seven
years. Mr. Beilby was not a wood engraver; and his business in the
copper-plate line was of a kind which did not allow of much scope for
the display of artistic talent. He engraved copper-plates for books,
when any by chance were offered to him; and he also executed
brass-plates for doors, with the names of the owners handsomely filled
up, after the manner of the old “<i>niellos</i>,” with black
sealing-wax. He engraved crests and initials on steel and silver
watch-seals; also on tea-spoons, sugar-tongs, and other articles of
plate; and the engraving of numerals and ornaments, with the name of the
maker, on clock-faces,&mdash;which were not then enamelled,&mdash;seems
to have formed one of the chief branches of his very general business.<a

<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page475" id = "page475">

<p>Bewick’s attention appears to have been first directed to wood
engraving in consequence of his master having been employed by the late
Dr. Charles Hutton, then a schoolmaster in Newcastle, to engrave on wood
the diagrams for his Treatise on Mensuration. The printing of this work
was commenced in 1768, and was completed in 1770. The engraving of the
diagrams was committed to Bewick, who is said to have invented a graver
with a fine groove at the point, which enabled him to cut the outlines
by a single operation.</p>

<p>The above is a fac-simile of one of the earliest productions of
Bewick in the art of wood engraving. The church is intended for that of
St. Nicholas, Newcastle.</p>

<p>Subsequently, and while he was still an apprentice, Bewick
undoubtedly endeavoured to improve himself in wood engraving; but his
progress does not appear to have been great, and his master had
certainly very little work of this kind for him to do. He appears to
have engraved a few bill-heads on wood; and it is not unlikely that the
cuts in a little book entitled “Youth’s Instructive and Entertaining
Story Teller,” first published by T.&nbsp;Saint, Newcastle, 1774, were
executed by him before the expiration of his apprenticeship.</p>

<p>Bewick, at one period during his apprenticeship, paid ninepence a
week for his lodgings in Newcastle, and usually received a brown loaf
every week from Cherry-burn. “During his servitude,” says Mr. Atkinson,
“he paid weekly visits to Cherry-burn, except when the river was so much
swollen as to prevent his passage of it at Eltringham, when he
vociferated his inquiries across the stream, and then returned to
Newcastle.” This account of his being accustomed to <i>shout</i> his
enquiries
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page476" id = "page476">

across the Tyne first appeared in a Memoir prefixed to the Select
Fables, published by E.&nbsp;Charnley, 1820. Mr. William Bedlington, an
old friend of Bewick, once asked him if it were true? “Babbles and
nonsense!” was the reply. “It never happened but once, and that was when
the river had suddenly swelled before I could reach the top of the
<i>allers</i>,<a class = "tag" name = "tagVII32" id = "tagVII32" href =
"#noteVII32">VII.32</a> and yet folks are made to believe that I was in
the habit of doing it.”</p>

<p>On the expiration of his apprenticeship he returned to his father’s
house at Cherry-burn, but still continued to work for Mr. Beilby. About
this time he seems to have formed the resolution of applying himself
exclusively in future to wood engraving, and with this view to have
executed several cuts as specimens of his ability. In 1775 he received a
premium of seven guineas from the Society of Arts for a cut of the
Huntsman and the Old Hound, which he probably engraved when living at
Cherry-burn after leaving Mr. Beilby.<a class = "tag" name = "tagVII33"
id = "tagVII33" href = "#noteVII33">VII.33</a> The following is a
fac-simile of this cut, which was first printed in an edition of Gay’s
Fables, published by T.&nbsp;Saint, Newcastle, 1779. Mr. Henry Bohn, the
publisher of the present edition, happening to be in possession of the
original cut, it is annexed on the opposite page.</p>

<p>In 1776, when on a visit to some of his relations in Cumberland,<a
class = "tag" name = "tagVII34" id = "tagVII34" href =
"#noteVII34">VII.34</a> he availed himself of the opportunity of
visiting the Lakes; and in after-life
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page477" id = "page477">
477</a></span>
he used frequently to speak in terms of admiration of the beauty of the
scenery, and of the neat appearance of the white-washed, slate-covered
cottages on the banks of some of the lakes. His tour was made on foot,
with a stick in his hand and a wallet at his back; and it has been
supposed that in a tail-piece, to be found at page 177 of the first
volume of his British Birds, first edition, 1797, he has introduced a
sketch of himself in his travelling costume, drinking out of what he
himself would have called the <i>flipe</i> of his hat. The figure has
been copied in our ornamental letter T at <a href = "#illus_471">page
471</a>.</p>

<img src = "images/illus_477.png" width = "272" height = "207"

<p>In the same year, 1776, he went to London, where he arrived on the
1st of October. He certainly did not remain more than a twelvemonth in
London,<a class = "tag" name = "tagVII35" id = "tagVII35" href =
"#noteVII35">VII.35</a> for in 1777 he returned to Newcastle, and
entered into partnership with his former master, Mr. Ralph Beilby.
Bewick&mdash;who does not appear to have been wishful to undeceive those
who fancied that he was the person who rediscovered the “long-lost art
of engraving on wood”<a class = "tag" name = "tagVII36" id = "tagVII36"
href = "#noteVII36">VII.36</a>&mdash;would never inform any of the
good-natured friends, who fished for intelligence with the view of
writing his life, of the works on which he was employed when in London.
The faith of a believer in the story of Bewick’s re-discovering “the
long-lost art” would have received too great a shock had he been told by
Bewick himself that
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page478" id = "page478">
478</a></span>
on his arrival in London he found professors of the “long-lost art”
regularly exercising their calling, and that with one of them he found
employment.</p>

<p>There is every reason to believe that Bewick, when in London, was
chiefly employed by T.&nbsp;Hodgson, most likely the person who engraved
the four cuts in Sir John Hawkins’s History of Music. It is at any rate
certain that several cuts engraved by Bewick appeared in a little work
entitled “A&nbsp;curious Hieroglyphick Bible,” printed by and for
T.&nbsp;Hodgson, in George’s Court, St. John’s Lane, Clerkenwell.<a
class = "tag" name = "tagVII37" id = "tagVII37" href =
"#noteVII37">VII.37</a> Proofs of three of the principal cuts are now
lying before me. The subjects are: Adam and Eve, with the Deity seen in
the clouds, forming the frontispiece; the Resurrection; and a cut
representing a gentleman seated in an arm-chair, with four boys beside
him: the border of this cut is of the same kind as that of the large cut
of the Chillingham Bull engraved by Bewick in 1789. These proofs appear
to have been presented by Bewick to an eminent painter, now dead, with
whom either then, or at a subsequent period, he had become acquainted.
Not one of Bewick’s biographers mentions those cuts, nor seems to have
been aware of their existence. The two memoirs of Bewick, written by his
“friends” G.&nbsp;C. Atkinson and John F.&nbsp;M. Dovaston,<a class =
"tag" name = "tagVII38" id = "tagVII38" href = "#noteVII38">VII.38</a>
sufficiently demonstrate that neither of them had enjoyed his confidence
in matters relative to his progress in the art of wood engraving.</p>

<p>Mr. Atkinson, in his Sketch of the Life and Works of Bewick, says
that when in London he worked with a person of the name of Cole. Of this
person, as a wood engraver, I&nbsp;have not been able to discover any
trace. Bewick did not like London; and he always advised his former
pupils and north-country friends to leave the “province covered with
houses” as soon as they could, and return to the country to there enjoy
the beauties of Nature, fresh air, and
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page479" id = "page479">
479</a></span>
content. In the letter to his old schoolfellow, Mr. Christopher Gregson,
previously quoted, he thus expresses his opinion of London life. “Ever
since you paid your last visit to the north, I&nbsp;have often been
thinking upon you, and wishing that you would <i>lap up</i>, and leave
the metropolis, to enjoy the fruits of your hard-earned industry on the
banks of the Tyne, where you are so much respected, both on your own
account and on that of those who are gone. Indeed, I&nbsp;wonder how you
can think of turmoiling yourself to the end of the chapter, and let the
opportunity slip of contemplating at your ease the beauties of Nature,
so bountifully spread out to enlighten, to captivate, and to cheer the
heart of man. For my part, I&nbsp;am still of the same mind that I was
in when in London, and that is, <i>I&nbsp;would rather be herding sheep
on Mickley bank top than remain in London, although for doing so I was
to be made the premier of England</i>.” Bewick was truly a
<i>country</i> man; he felt that it was better “to hear the lark sing
than the mouse cheep;” for, though no person was capable of closer
application to his art when within doors, he loved to spend his hours of
relaxation in the open air, studying the character of beasts and birds
in their natural state; and diligently noting those little incidents and
traits of country life which give so great an interest to many of his
tail-pieces. When a young man, he was fond of angling; and, like Roger
Ascham, he “dearly loved a main of cocks.” When annoyed by
street-walkers in London, he used to assume the air of a stupid
countryman, and, in reply to their importunity, would ask, with an
expression of stolid gravity, if they knew “Tommy Hummel&nbsp;o’
Prudhoe, Willy Eltringham&nbsp;o’ Hall-Yards, or Auld Laird
Newton&nbsp;o’ Mickley?”<a class = "tag" name = "tagVII39" id =
"tagVII39" href = "#noteVII39">VII.39</a> He thus, without losing his
temper, or showing any feeling of annoyance, soon got quit of those who
wished to engage his attention, though sometimes not until he had
received a hearty malediction for his stupidity.</p>

<p>In 1777, on his return to Newcastle, he entered into partnership with
Mr. Beilby; and his younger brother, John Bewick, who was then about
seventeen years old, became their apprentice. From this time Bewick,
though he continued to assist his partner in the other branches of their
business,<a class = "tag" name = "tagVII40" id = "tagVII40" href =
"#noteVII40">VII.40</a> applied himself chiefly to engraving on
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page480" id = "page480">
480</a></span>
wood. The cuts in an edition of Gay’s Fables, 1779,<a class = "tag" name
= "tagVII41" id = "tagVII41" href = "#noteVII41">VII.41</a> and in an
edition of Select Fables, 1784, both printed by T.&nbsp;Saint,
Newcastle, were engraved by Bewick, who was probably assisted by his
brother. Several of those cuts are well engraved, though by no means to
be compared to his later works, executed when he had acquired greater
knowledge of the art, and more confidence in his own powers. He
evidently improved as his talents were exercised; for the cuts in the
Select Fables, 1784, are generally much superior to those in Gay’s
Fables, 1779; the animals are better drawn and engraved; the sketches of
landscape in the back-grounds are more natural; and the engraving of the
foliage of the trees and bushes is, not unfrequently, scarce inferior to
that of his later productions. Such an attention to nature in this
respect is not to be found in any wood-cuts of an earlier date. The
following impressions from two of the original cuts in the Select Fables
are fair specimens; one is interesting, as being Bewick’s first idea of
a favourite vignette in his British Land
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page481" id = "page481">
481</a></span>
Birds; the other as his first treatment of the lion and the four bulls,
afterwards repeated in his Quadrupeds. In the best cuts of the time of
Durer and Holbein the foliage is generally neglected; the artists of
that period merely give general forms of trees, without ever attending
to that which contributes so much to their beauty. The merit of
introducing this great improvement in wood engraving, and of depicting
quadrupeds and birds in their natural forms, and with their
characteristic expression, is undoubtedly due to Bewick. Though he was
not the discoverer of the art of wood engraving, he certainly was the
first who applied it with success to the delineation of animals, and to
the natural representation of landscape and woodland scenery. He found
for himself a path which no previous wood engraver had trodden, and in
which none of his successors have gone beyond him. For several of the
cuts in the Select Fables, Bewick was paid only nine shillings each.</p>

<p>In 1789 he drew and engraved his large cut of the Chillingham Bull,<a
class = "tag" name = "tagVII42" id = "tagVII42" href =
"#noteVII42">VII.42</a> which many persons suppose to be his
master-piece; but though it is certainly well engraved, and the
character of the animal is well expressed, yet as a wood engraving it
will not bear a comparison with several of the cuts in his History of
British Birds. The grass and the foliage of the trees are most
beautifully expressed; but there is a want of variety in the more
distant trees, and the bark of that in the fore-ground to the left is
too rough. This exaggeration of the roughness of the bark of trees is
also to be perceived in many of his other cuts. The style in which the
bull is engraved is admirably adapted to express the texture of the
short white hair of the animal; the dewlap, however, is not well
represented, it appears to be stiff instead of flaccid and pendulous;
and the lines intended for the hairs on its margin are too <i>wiry</i>.
On a stone in the fore-ground he has introduced a <i>bit</i> of
cross-hatching, but not with good effect, for it causes the stone to
look very much like an old scrubbing-brush. Bewick was not partial to
cross-hatching, and it is seldom to be found in cuts of his engraving.
He seems to have introduced it in this cut rather to show to those who
knew anything of the matter that he could engrave such lines, than from
an opinion that they were necessary, or in the slightest degree improved
the cut. This is almost the only instance in which Bewick has introduced
black lines crossing each other, and thus forming what is usually called
“cross-hatchings.” From the commencement of his career as a wood
engraver, he adopted a much more simple method of obtaining colour. He
very justly considered, that, as impressions of wood-cuts are printed
from lines engraved in <i>relief</i>, the unengraved
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page482" id = "page482">
482</a></span>
surface of the block already represented the darkest colour that could
be produced; and consequently, instead of labouring to produce colour in
the same manner as the old wood engravers, he commenced upon colour or
black, and proceeded from <i>dark to light</i> by means of lines cut in
intaglio, and appearing white when in the impression, until his subject
was completed. This great simplification of the old process was the
result of his having to engrave his own drawings; for in drawing his
subject on the wood he avoided all combinations of lines which to the
designer are easy, but to the engraver difficult. In almost every one of
his cuts the effect is produced by the simplest means. The colour which
the old wood engravers obtained by means of cross-hatchings, Bewick
obtained with much greater facility by means of single lines, and masses
of black slightly intersected or broken with white.</p>

<p>When only a few impressions of the Chillingham Bull had been taken,
and before he had added his name, the block split. The pressmen, it is
said, got tipsy over their work, and left the block lying on the
window-sill exposed to the rays of the sun, which caused it to warp and
split.<a class = "tag" name = "tagVII43" id = "tagVII43" href =
"#noteVII43">VII.43</a> About six impressions were taken on thin vellum
before the accident occurred. Mr. Atkinson says that one of those
impressions, which had formerly belonged to Mr. Beilby, Bewick’s
partner, was sold in London for twenty pounds; A.&nbsp;Stothard, R.A.,
had one, as had also Mr. C.&nbsp;Nesbit.</p>

<p>Towards the latter end of 1785 Bewick began to engrave the cuts for
his General History of Quadrupeds, which was first printed in 1790.<a
class = "tag" name = "tagVII44" id = "tagVII44" href =
"#noteVII44">VII.44</a> The descriptions were written by his partner,
Mr. Beilby, and the cuts were all drawn and engraved by himself. The
comparative excellence of those cuts, which, for the correct delineation
of the animals and the natural character of the <i>incidents</i>, and
the back-grounds, are greatly superior to anything of the kind that had
previously appeared, insured a rapid sale for the work; a&nbsp;second
edition was published in 1791, and a third in 1792.<a class = "tag" name
= "tagVII45" id = "tagVII45" href = "#noteVII45">VII.45</a></p>

<p>The great merit of those cuts consists not so much in their execution
as in the spirited and natural manner in which they are drawn. Some of
the animals, indeed, which he had not had an opportunity of seeing, and
for which he had to depend on the previous engravings of others, are not
correctly drawn. Among the most incorrect are the Bison, the
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page483" id = "page483">
483</a></span>
Zebu, the Buffalo, the Many-horned Sheep, the Gnu, and the Giraffe or
Cameleopard.<a class = "tag" name = "tagVII46" id = "tagVII46" href =
"#noteVII46">VII.46</a> Even in some of our domestic quadrupeds he was
not successful; the Horses are not well represented; and the very
indifferent execution of the Common Bull and Cow, at page 19, edition
1790, is only redeemed by the interest of the back-grounds. In that of
the Common Bull, the action of the bull seen chasing a man is most
excellent; and in that of the Cow, the woman, with a <i>skeel</i> on her
head, and her petticoats tucked up behind, returning from milking, is
evidently a sketch from nature. The Goats and the Dogs are the best of
those cuts both in design and execution; and perhaps the very best of
all the cuts in the first edition is that of the Cur Fox at page 270.
The tail of the animal, which is too long, and is also incorrectly
marked with black near the white tip, was subsequently altered.</p>

<p>In the first edition the characteristic tail-pieces are comparatively
few; and several of those which are merely ornamental, displaying
neither imagination nor feeling, are copies of cuts which are frequent
in books printed at Leipsic between 1770 and 1780, and which were
probably engraved by Ungher, a&nbsp;German wood engraver of that period.
Examples of such tasteless trifles are to be found at pages 9, 12, 18,
65, 110, 140, 201, 223, and 401. Ornaments of the same character occur
in Heineken’s “Idée Générale d’une Collection complette d’Estampes,”
Leipsic and Vienna, 1771. Bewick was unquestionably better acquainted
with the history and progress of wood engraving than those who talk
about the “long-lost art” were aware of. The first of the two following
cuts is a fac-simile of a tail-piece which occurs in an edition of “Der
Weiss Kunig,”<a class = "tag" name = "tagVII47" id = "tagVII47" href =
"#noteVII47">VII.47</a> printed at Vienna, 1775, and which Bewick has
copied at page 144 of the first edition of the
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page484" id = "page484">
484</a></span>
Quadrupeds, 1790. The second, from one of the cuts illustrative of
Ovid’s Metamorphoses, 1569, designed by Virgil Solis,<a class = "tag"
name = "tagVII48" id = "tagVII48" href = "#noteVII48">VII.48</a> is
copied in a tail-piece in the first volume of Bewick’s Birds, page 330,
edition 1797.</p>

<p>The following may be mentioned as the best of the tail-pieces in the
first edition of the Quadrupeds, and as those which most decidedly
display Bewick’s talent in depicting, without exaggeration, natural and
humorous incidents. In this respect he has been excelled by no other
artist either of past or present times. The Elephant, fore-shortened, at
page 162; the Dog and Cat, 195; the Old Man crossing a ford, mounted on
an old horse, which carries, in addition, two heavy sacks, 244; the
Bear-ward, with his wife and companion, leading Bruin, and accompanied
by his dancing-dogs,&mdash;a gallows seen in the distance, 256;
a&nbsp;Fox, with Magpies flying after him, indicating his course to his
pursuers, 265; Two unfeeling fellows enjoying the pleasure of hanging a
dog,&mdash;a gibbet, seen in the distance, to denote that those who
could thus quietly enjoy the dying struggles of a dog would not be
unlikely to murder a man, 274; a&nbsp;Man eating his dinner with his dog
sitting beside him, expecting his share, 285; Old Blind Man led by a
dog, crossing a bridge of a single plank, and with the rail broken, in a
storm of wind and rain, 320; a&nbsp;Mad Dog pursued by three
men,&mdash;a feeble old woman directly in the dog’s way, 324; a&nbsp;Man
with a bundle at his back, crossing a stream on stilts, 337;
a&nbsp;winter piece,&mdash;a Man travelling in the snow, 339;
a&nbsp;grim-visaged Old Man, accompanied by a cur-dog, driving an old
sow, 371; Two Boys and an Ass on a common, 375; a&nbsp;Man leaping, by
means of a pole, a&nbsp;stream, across which he has previously thrown
his stick and bag, 391; a&nbsp;Man carrying a bundle of faggots on the
ice, 395; a&nbsp;Wolf falling into a trap, 430; and Two Blind Fiddlers
and a Boy, the last in the book, at 456. In this cut Bewick has
represented the two blind fiddlers earnestly scraping away, although
there is no one to listen to their strains; the bare-legged
<i>tatty</i>-headed boy who leads them, and the half-starved
melancholy-looking dog at their heels, are in admirable keeping with the
principal characters.</p>

<p>On the next page is a copy of the cut of the Two Boys and the Ass,
previously mentioned as occurring at page 375. This cut, beyond any
other of the tail-pieces in the first edition of the Quadrupeds, perhaps
affords the best specimen of Bewick’s peculiar talent of depicting such
subjects; he faithfully represents Nature, and at the same time conveys
a moral, which gives additional interest to the sketch. Though the ass
remains immoveable, in spite of the application of
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page485" id = "page485">
485</a></span>
a branch of furze to his hind quarters, the young graceless who is
mounted evidently enjoys his seat. The pleasure of the twain consists as
much in having <i>caught</i> an ass as in the prospect of a <ins class =
"correction" title = ". missing">ride.</ins> To such characters the
stubborn ass frequently affords more <i>amusement</i> than a willing
goer; they like to flog and thump a thing well, though it be but a
gate-post. The gallows in the distance&mdash;a favourite <i>in
terrorem</i> object with Bewick&mdash;suggests their ultimate destiny;
and the cut, in the first edition, derives additional <i>point</i> from
its situation among the animals found in <i>New South
Wales</i>,&mdash;the first shipment of convicts to Botany Bay having
taken place about two years previous to the publication of the work.
This cut, as well as many others in the book, affords an instance of
lowering,&mdash;the light appearance of the distance is entirely
effected by that process.</p>

<p>The subsequent editions of the Quadrupeds were enlarged by the
addition of new matter and the insertion of several new cuts. Of these,
with the exception of the Kyloe Ox,<a class = "tag" name = "tagVII49" id

the best. The following are the principal cuts of animals that have been
added since the first publication of the work; the pages annexed refer
to the edition of 1824, the last that was published in Bewick’s
life-time: the Arabian Horse, page 4,&mdash;the stallion, seen in the
back-ground, has suffered a dismemberment since its first appearance;<a

Tees-water Ram of the Old Breed, 60; Tees-water Ram, Improved Breed, 61;
the American Elk, 125; Sow of the Improved Breed, 164; Sow

of the Chinese Breed, 166; Head of a Hippopotamus, (engraved by
W.&nbsp;W. Temple,) 185; Indian Bear, 293; Polar, or Great White Bear,
substituted for another cut of the same animal, 295; the Spotted Hyena,
substituted for another cut of the same animal, 301; the Ban-dog, 338;
the Irish Greyhound, 340; the Harrier, 347; Spotted Bavy, substituted

Long-tailed Squirrel, 396; the Jerboa, substituted for another cut of
the same animal, 397; the Musquash, or Musk Beaver, 416; the Mouse,
substituted for another cut of the same animal, 424; the Short-eared
Bat, 513; the Long-eared Bat, 515; the Ternate Bat, 518; the Wombach,
523; and the Ornithorhynchus Paradoxicus, 525. The cut of the animal
called the Thick-nosed Tapiir, at page 139 of the first edition, is
transposed to page 381 of the last edition, and there described under
the name of the Capibara: it is probably intended for the Coypu rat,
a&nbsp;specimen of which is at present in the Gardens of the Zoological
Society, Regent’s Park. Bewick was a regular visitor of all the
wild-beast shows that came to Newcastle, and availed himself of every
opportunity to obtain drawings from living animals.</p>

<p>The tail-pieces introduced in subsequent editions of the Quadrupeds

half-starved old horse,&mdash;broken-kneed, greasy-heeled, and evidently
troubled with the string-halt, as is indicated by the action of the
<i>off</i> hind-leg,&mdash;hesitates to descend the brae, at the foot of
which there is a stream, and the old brute on his back urges him forward
by <i>working</i> him, as jockeys say, with the halter, and beating him
with his stick. In the distance, Bewick, as is usual with him when he
gives a sketch of cruelty or knavery, has introduced a gallows. The
miserable appearance of the poor animal is not a little increased by the
nakedness of his hind quarters; his stump of a tail is so short that it
will not even serve as a <i>catch</i> for the crupper or
<i>tail-band</i>.</p>

<p>In the cut of the child, unconscious of its danger, pulling at the
long tail of a young unbroken colt, the story is most admirably told.
The nurse, who is seen engaged with her sweetheart by the side of the
hedge, has left the child to wander at will, and thus expose itself to
destruction; while the mother, who has accidentally perceived the danger
of her darling, is seen hastening over the stile, regardless of the
steps, in an agony of fear. The backward glance of the horse’s eye, and
the heel raised ready to strike, most forcibly suggest the danger to
which the unthinking infant is exposed.</p>

<p>Though the subject of the following cut be simple, yet the
<i>sentiment</i> which it displays is the genuine offspring of true
genius. Near to a ruined cottage, while all around is covered with snow,
a&nbsp;lean and hungry ewe is seen nibbling at an old broom, while her
young and
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page488" id = "page488">
488</a></span>
weakly lamb is sucking her milkless teats. Such a picture of animal
want&mdash;conceived with so much feeling, and so well
expressed,&mdash;has perhaps never been represented by any artist except
Bewick.</p>

<p>The original of the following cut forms the tail-piece to the last
page of the edition of 1824. An old man, wearing a parson’s cast-off
beaver and wig, is seen carrying his young wife and child across a
stream. The complacent look of the cock-nosed wife shows that she enjoys
the treat, while the old drudge patiently bears his burden, and with his
right hand keeps a firm <i>grip</i> of the nether end of his better
part. This cut is an excellent satire on those old men who marry young
wives and become dotingly uxorious in the decline of life; submitting to
every indignity to please their youthful spouses and reconcile them to
their state. It is a <i>new reading</i> of January and May,&mdash;he an
old travelling beggar, and she a young slut with her heels peeping, or
rather staring, through her stockings.</p>

<p>Mr. Solomon Hodgson, the printer of the first four editions of the
Quadrupeds, had an interest in the work; he died in 1800; and in
consequence of a misunderstanding between his widow and Bewick, the
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page489" id = "page489">
489</a></span>
latter had the subsequent editions printed at the office of Mr. Edward
Walker. Mrs. Hodgson having asserted, in a letter printed in the Monthly
Magazine for July 1805, that Bewick was neither the author nor the
projector of the History of Quadrupeds, but “was employed merely as the
engraver or wood-cutter,” he, in justification of his own claims, gave
the following account of the origin of the work.<a class = "tag" name =
"tagVII52" id = "tagVII52" href = "#noteVII52">VII.52</a> “From my first
reading, when a boy at school, a&nbsp;sixpenny History of Birds and
Beasts, and a then wretched composition called the History of Three
Hundred Animals, to the time I became acquainted with works on Natural
History written for the perusal of men, I&nbsp;never was without the
design of attempting something of this kind myself; but my principal
object was (and still&nbsp;is) directed to the mental pleasure and
improvement of youth; to engage their attention, to direct their steps
aright, and to lead them on till they become enamoured of this innocent
and delightful pursuit. Some time after my partnership with Mr. Beilby
commenced, I&nbsp;communicated my wishes to him, who, after many
conversations, came into my plan of publishing a History of Quadrupeds,
and I then immediately began to draw the animals, to design the
vignettes, and to cut them on wood, and this, to avoid interruption,
frequently till very late in the night; my partner at the same time
undertaking to compile and draw up the descriptions and history at his
leisure hours and evenings at home. With the accounts of the foreign
animals I did not much interfere; the sources whence I had drawn the
little knowledge I possessed were open to my coadjutor, and he used
them; but to those of the animals of our own country, as my partner
before this time had paid little attention to natural history,
I&nbsp;lent a helping hand. This help was given in daily conversations,
and in occasional notes and memoranda, which were used in their proper
places. As the cuts were engraved, we employed the late Mr. Thomas
Angus, of this town, printer, to take off a certain number of
impressions of each, many of which are still in my possession. At Mr.
Angus’s death the charge for this business was not made in his books,
and at the request of his widow and ourselves, the late Mr. Solomon
Hodgson fixed the price; and yet the widow and executrix of Mr. Hodgson
asserts in your Magazine, that I was ‘merely employed as the engraver or
wood-cutter,’ (I&nbsp;suppose) by her husband! Had this been the case,
is it probable that Mr. Hodgson would have had the cuts printed in any
other office than his own? The fact is the reverse of Mrs. Hodgson’s
statement; and although I have never, either ‘insidiously’ or otherwise,
used any means to cause the reviewers, or others, to hold me up as the
‘first and sole mover of the concern,’ I&nbsp;am now dragged forth by
her to declare that <i>I am the man</i>.</p>

<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page490" id = "page490">
490</a></span>
<p>“But to return to my story:&mdash;while we were in the progress of
our work, prudence suggested that it might be necessary to inquire how
our labours were to be ushered to the world, and, as we were
unacquainted with the printing and publishing of books, what mode was
the most likely to insure success. Upon this subject Mr. Hodgson was
consulted, and made fully acquainted with our plan. He entered into the
undertaking with uncommon ardour, and urged us strenuously not to retain
our first humble notions of ‘making it like a school-book,’ but pressed
us to let it ‘assume a more respectable form.’ From this warmth of our
friend we had no hesitation in offering him a share in the work, and a
copartnership deed was entered into between us, for that purpose, on the
10th of April 1790. What Mr. Hodgson did in correcting the press, beyond
what falls to the duty of every printer, I&nbsp;know not; but I am
certain that he was extremely desirous that it should have justice done
it. In this <i>weaving of words</i> I did not interfere, as I believed
it to be in hands much fitter than my own, only I took the liberty of
blotting out whatever I knew not to be truth.”</p>

<p>The favourable manner in which the History of Quadrupeds was received
determined Bewick to commence without delay his History of British
Birds. He began to draw and engrave the cuts in 1791, and in 1797 the
first volume of the work, containing the Land Birds, was published.<a
class = "tag" name = "tagVII53" id = "tagVII53" href =
"#noteVII53">VII.53</a> The letter-press, as in the Quadrupeds, was
written by his partner, Mr. Beilby, who certainly deserves great praise
for the manner in which he has performed his task. The descriptions
generally have the great merit of being simple, intelligible, and
correct. There are no trifling details about system, no confused
arguments about classification, which more frequently bewilder than
inform the reader who is uninitiated in the piebald jargon of what is
called “Systematic nomenclature.” He describes the quadruped or bird in
a manner which enables even the most unlearned to recognize it when he
sees it; and, like one who is rather wishful to inform his readers than
to display his own acquaintance with the scientific vocabulary, he
carefully avoids the use of all terms which are not generally
understood. Mr. Beilby, though in a different manner and in a less
degree, is fairly entitled to share with Bewick in the honour of having
rendered popular in this country the study of the most interesting and
useful branches of Zoology&mdash;Quadrupeds and Birds&mdash;by giving
the descriptions in simple and intelligible language, and presenting to
the eye the very form and character of the living animals. As a
copper-plate engraver, Mr. Beilby has certainly no just pretensions
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page491" id = "page491">
491</a></span>
to fame; but as a compiler, and as an able coadjutor of Bewick in
simplifying the study of Natural History, and rendering its most
interesting portions easy of attainment to the young, and to those
unacquainted with the “science,” he deserves higher praise than he has
hitherto generally received. Roger Thornton’s Monument, and the Plan of
Newcastle, in the Reverend John Brand’s History of that town, were
engraved by Mr. Beilby. Mr. Brand’s book-plate was also engraved by him.
It is to be found in most of the books that formerly belonged to that
celebrated antiquary, who is well known to all collectors from the
extent of his purchases at stalls, and the number of curious old books
which he thus occasionally obtained.&mdash;The Reverend William Turner,
of Newcastle, in a letter printed in the Monthly Magazine for June 1801,
vindicates the character of Mr. Beilby from what he considers the
detractions of Dr. Gleig, in an article on Wood-cuts in the Supplement
to the Encyclopedia Britannica. Mr. Beilby was a native of the city of
Durham, and was brought up as a silversmith and seal-engraver under his
father. He died at Newcastle on the 4th of January 1817, in the
seventy-fourth year of his age.</p>

<p>The partnership between Beilby and Bewick having been dissolved in
1797, shortly after the publication of the first volume of the Birds,
the descriptions in the second, which did not appear till 1804, were
written by Bewick himself, but revised by the Reverend Henry Cotes,
vicar of Bedlington. The publication of this volume formed the key-stone
of Bewick’s fame as a designer and engraver on wood; for though the cuts
are not superior to those of the first, they are not excelled, nor
indeed equalled, by any that he afterwards executed. The subsequent
additions, whether as cuts of birds or tail-pieces, are not so excellent
as numerous&mdash;in this respect the reverse of the additions to the
Quadrupeds. Though all the birds were designed, and nearly all of them
engraved by Bewick himself, there are yet living witnesses who can
testify that both in the drawing and the engraving of the tail-pieces he
received very considerable assistance from his pupils, more especially
from Robert Johnson as a draftsman, and Luke Clennell as a wood
engraver.<a class = "tag" name = "tagVII54" id = "tagVII54" href =
"#noteVII54">VII.54</a> Before saying anything further on this subject,
it seems
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page492" id = "page492">
492</a></span>
necessary to give the following passage from Mr. Atkinson’s Sketch of
the Life and Works of Bewick. “With regard to the circumstance that the
<i>British Birds</i>, with very few exceptions, were finished by his own
hand, I&nbsp;have it in my power to pledge myself. I&nbsp;had been a
good deal surprised one day by hearing a gentleman assert that very few
of them were his own work, all the easy parts being executed by his
pupils. I&nbsp;saw him the same day, and, talking of his art, inquired
if he permitted the assistance of his apprentices in many cases? He
said, ‘No; it had seldom happened, and then they had injured the cuts
very much.’ I&nbsp;inquired if he could remember any of them in which he
had received assistance? He said, ‘Aye: I&nbsp;can soon tell you them;’
and, after a few minutes’ consideration, he made out, with his
daughter’s assistance, <i>the Whimbrel</i>, <i>Tufted Duck</i>, and
<i>Lesser Tern</i>:<a class = "tag" name = "tagVII55" id = "tagVII55"
href = "#noteVII55">VII.55</a> he tried to recollect more, and turning
to his daughter, said, ‘Jane, honey, dost thou remember any more?’ She
considered a little, and said, ‘No: she did not; but that certainly
there were not half a dozen in all:’ those we both pressed him to do
over again. ‘He intended it,’ he said; but, alas! this intention was
prevented. In some cases, I&nbsp;am informed, he made his pupils block
out for him; that is, furnished them with an outline, and let them cut
away the edges of the block to that line; but as, in this case, the
assistance rendered is much the same as that afforded by a turner’s
apprentice when he rounds off the heavy mass of wood in readiness for a
more experienced hand, but not a line of whose performance remains in
the beautiful toy it becomes, it does not materially shake the
authenticity of the work in question.”</p>

<p>Though it is evident that Bewick meant here simply to assert that all
the <i>figures</i> of the <i>birds</i>, except the few which he
mentions, were entirely engraved by himself, yet his biographer always
speaks as if <i>every one</i> of the cuts in the work&mdash;both birds
and tail-pieces&mdash;were exclusively engraved by Bewick himself; and
in consequence of this erroneous opinion he refers to seven cuts<a class
= "tag" name = "tagVII56" id = "tagVII56" href = "#noteVII56">VII.56</a>
as affording favourable
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page493" id = "page493">
493</a></span>
instances of Bewick’s manner of representing water, although <i>not
one</i> of them was engraved by him, but by Luke Clennell, from drawings
by himself or by Robert Johnson. Mr. Atkinson, in his admiration of
Bewick, and in his desire to exaggerate his fame, entirely overlooks the
merits of those by whom he was assisted. Charlton Nesbit and Luke
Clennell rendered him more assistance, though not in the cuts of birds,
than such as that “afforded by a turner’s apprentice when he rounds off
the heavy mass of wood;” and Robert Johnson, who designed many of the
best of the tail-pieces, drew the human figure more correctly than
Bewick himself, and in landscape-drawing was at least his equal. These
observations are not intended in the least to detract from Bewick’s just
and deservedly great reputation, but to correct the erroneous opinions
which have been promulgated on this subject by persons who knew nothing
of the very considerable assistance which he received from his pupils in
the drawing and engraving of the tail-pieces in his history of British
Birds.</p>

<p>Though three of the best specimens of Bewick’s talents as a designer
and engraver on wood&mdash;the Bittern, the Wood-cock, and the Common
Duck<a class = "tag" name = "tagVII57" id = "tagVII57" href =
"#noteVII57">VII.57</a>&mdash;are to be found in the second volume,
containing the water-birds, yet the land-birds in the first volume, from
his being more familiar with their habits, and in consequence of their
allowing more scope for the display of Bewick’s excellence in the
representation of
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page494" id = "page494">
494</a></span>
foliage, are, on the whole, superior both in design and execution to the
others; their characteristic attitude and expression are represented
with the greatest truth, while, from the propriety of the back-grounds,
and the beauty of the trees and foliage, almost every cut forms a
perfect little picture. Bewick’s talent in pourtraying the form and
character of birds is seen to great advantage in the hawks and the owls;
but his excellence, both as a designer and engraver on wood, is yet more
strikingly displayed in several of the other cuts contained in the same
volume, and among these the following are perhaps the best. The numbers
refer to the pages of the first edition of the Land Birds, 1797. The
Field-fare, page 98; the Yellow Bunting, a&nbsp;most exquisite cut, and
considered by Bewick as the best that he ever engraved, 143; the
Goldfinch, 165; the Skylark, 178; the Woodlark, 183; the Lesser and the
Winter Fauvette, 212, 213; the Willow Wren, 222; the Wren, 227; the
White-rump, 229; the Cole Titmouse, 241; the Night-Jar, 262; the
Domestic Cock, 276; the Turkey, 286; the Pintado, 293; the Red Grouse,
301; the Partridge, 305; the Quail, 308; and the Corncrake,
311.&mdash;Among the Birds in the second volume, first edition, 1804,
the following may be instanced as the most excellent. The Water Crake,
page 10; the Water Rail, 13; the Bittern, 47; the Woodcock, 60; the
Common Snipe, 68; the Judcock, or Jack Snipe, 73; the Dunlin, 117; the
Dun Diver, 257; the Grey Lag Goose, 292; and the Common Duck, 333.</p>

<p>Nothing of the same kind that wood engraving has produced since the
time of Bewick can for a moment bear a comparison with these cuts. They
are not to be equalled till a designer and engraver shall arise
possessed of Bewick’s knowledge of nature, and endowed with his happy
talent of expressing it. Bewick has in this respect effected more by
himself than has been produced by one of our best wood engravers when
working from drawings made by a professional designer, but who knows
nothing of birds, of their habits, or the places which they frequent;
and has not the slightest feeling for natural incident or picturesque
beauty.&mdash;No mere fac-simile engraver of a drawing ready made to his
hand, should venture to speak slightingly of Bewick’s talents until he
has both <i>drawn and engraved</i> a cut which may justly challenge a
comparison with the Kyloe Ox, the Yellow-hammer, the Partridge, the
Wood-cock, or the Tame Duck.</p>

<p>Bewick’s style of engraving, as displayed in the Birds, is
exclusively his own. He adopts no conventional mode of representing
texture or producing an effect, but skilfully avails himself of the most
simple and effective means which his art affords of faithfully and
efficiently representing his subject. He never wastes his time in
laborious trifling to display his skill in execution;&mdash;he works
with a higher aim, to represent
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page495" id = "page495">
495</a></span>
nature; and, consequently, he never bestows his pains except to express
a meaning. The manner in which he has represented the feathers in many
of his birds, is as admirable as it is perfectly original. His feeling
for his subject, and his knowledge of his art, suggest the best means of
effecting his end, and the manner in which he has employed them entitle
him to rank as a wood engraver&mdash;without reference to his merits as
a designer&mdash;among the very best that have practised the art.</p>

<p class = "illustration">
<a name = "illus_495" id = "illus_495">&nbsp;</a>
<img src = "images/illus_495.png" width = "298" height = "188"
alt = "see text"></p>

<p>Our copy of his cut of the Partridge, though not equal to the
original, will perhaps to a certain extent serve to exemplify his
practice. Every line that is to be perceived in this bird is the best
that could have been devised to express the engraver’s perfect idea of
his subject. The soft downy plumage of the breast is represented by
delicate black lines crossed horizontally by white ones, and in order
that they may appear comparatively light in the impression, the block
has in this part been lowered. The texture of the skin of the legs, and
the marks of the toes, are expressed with the greatest accuracy; and the
varied tints of the plumage of the rump, back, wings, and head, are
indicated with no less fidelity.&mdash;Such a cut as this Bewick would
execute in less time than a modern French wood engraver would require to
cut the delicate cross-hatchings necessary, according to French taste,
to denote the grey colour of a soldier’s great coat.</p>

<p>The cut of the Wood-cock, of which that on the next page is a copy,
is another instance of the able manner in which Bewick has availed
himself of the capabilities of his art. He has here produced the most
perfect likeness of the bird that ever was engraved, and at the same
time given to his subject an effect, by the skilful management of light
and shade, which it is impossible to obtain by means of copper-plate
engraving. Bewick thoroughly understood the advantages of his art in
this
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page496" id = "page496">
496</a></span>
respect, and no wood engraver or designer, either ancient or modern, has
employed them with greater success, without sacrificing nature to mere
effect.</p>

<p class = "illustration">
<a name = "illus_496" id = "illus_496">&nbsp;</a>
<img src = "images/illus_496.png" width = "310" height = "243"
alt = "see text"></p>

<p>Among the very best of Bewick’s cuts, as a specimen of wood
engraving, is, as we have already said, the Common Duck. The round, full
form of the bird, is represented with the greatest fidelity; the plumage
in all its downy, smooth, and glossy variety,&mdash;on the sides, the
rump, the back, the wings, and the head,&mdash;is singularly true to
nature; while the legs and toes, and even the webs between the toes, are
engraved in a manner which proves the great attention that Bewick, when
necessary, paid to the minutest points of detail. The effect of the
whole is excellent, and the back-ground, both in character and
execution, is worthy of this master-piece of Bewick as a designer and
engraver on wood.</p>

<p>The tail-pieces in the first editions of the Birds are, taken all
together, the best that are to be found in any of Bewick’s works; but,
though it is not unlikely that he suggested the subjects, there is
reason to believe that many of them were drawn by Robert Johnson, and
there cannot be a doubt that the greater number of those contained in
the second volume were engraved by Luke Clennell. Before saying anything
more about them, it seems necessary to give a list of those which were
either not drawn or not engraved by Bewick himself; it has been
furnished by one of his early pupils who saw most of Johnson’s drawings,
and worked in the same room with Clennell when he was engraving those
which are here ascribed to him. The pages show where those cuts are to
be found in the edition of 1797 and in that of 1821.</p>

<p>This list might be considerably increased by inserting many other
tail-pieces engraved by Clennell; but this does not appear necessary, as
a sufficient number has been enumerated to show that both in the
designing and in the engraving of those cuts Bewick received very
considerable assistance from his pupils. In the additional tail-pieces
to be found in subsequent editions the greater number are not engraved
by Bewick himself. In the last edition, published in 1832, there are at
least thirty engraved by his pupils subsequent to the time of
Clennell.</p>

<p>The head-piece at the commencement of the introduction,
volume&nbsp;<span class = "smallroman">I.</span> page vii. drawn and
engraved by Bewick himself, presents an excellent view of a farm-yard.
Everything is true to nature; the birds assembled near the woman seen
winnowing corn are, though on a small scale, represented with the
greatest fidelity; even among the smallest the wagtail can be
distinguished from the sparrow. The dog, feeling no interest in the
business, is seen quietly resting on the dunghill; but the chuckling of
the hens, announcing that something like eating is going forward, has
evidently excited the attention of the old sow, and brought her and her
litter into the yard in the expectation of getting a share. The season,
the latter end of autumn, is indicated by the flight of field-fares, and
the comparatively naked appearance of the trees; and we perceive that it
is a clear, bright day from the strong shadow of the ladder projected
against the wall, and on the thatched roof of the outhouse.
A&nbsp;heron, a&nbsp;crow, and a magpie are perceived nailed against the
gable end of the barn; and a couple of pigeons are seen flying above the
house. The cut forms at once an interesting picture of country life, and
a graphic summary of the contents of the work.</p>

<p>Among the tail-pieces drawn and engraved by Bewick himself, in the
first edition of the Birds, the following appear most deserving of
notice. In volume&nbsp;<span class = "smallroman">I.</span>: A traveller
drinking,&mdash;supposed to represent a sketch of his own costume when
making a tour of the Lakes in 1776,&mdash;introduced twice, at the end
of the contents, page xxx. and again at page 177. A&nbsp;man
<i>watering</i>, in a different sense to the preceding, a&nbsp;very
natural, though not a very delicate subject, at page 42. At page 62, an
old miller, lying asleep behind some bushes; he has evidently been tipsy
and from the date on a stone to the left, we are led to suppose that
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page499" id = "page499">

he had been indulging too freely on <ins class = "correction" title =
"text reads ‘the the’">the</ins> King’s birth-day, 4th June. The
following is a copy of the cut.</p>

Two cows standing in a pool, under the shade of a <i>dyke-back</i>, on a
warm day, page 74. In this cut Bewick has introduced a sketch of a
magpie chased by a hawk, but saved from the talons of its pursuer by the
timely interference of a couple of crows. Winter scene, of which the
following is a copy, at page 78. Some boys have made a large snow man,
which excites the special wonderment of a horse; and Bewick, to give the
subject a moral application, has added “<i>Esto perpetua!</i>” at the
bottom of the cut: the great work of the little men, however they may
admire it, and wish for its endurance, will be dissolved on the first
thaw.</p>

<p class = "continue">
At page 97 the appearance of mist and rain is well expressed; and in the
cut of a poacher tracking a hare, the snow is no less naturally
represented. At page 157, a&nbsp;man riding with a <i>howdy</i>&mdash;a
midwife&mdash;behind him, part of the cut appears covered with a leaf.
Bewick once being asked the meaning of this, said that “it was done to
indicate that the scene which was to follow required to be concealed.”
At page 194 we perceive a full-fed old churl hanging his cat; at page
226, a&nbsp;hen attacking a dog; and at page 281, two cocks
fighting,&mdash;all three excellent of their kind.</p>

<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page500" id = "page500">
500</a></span>
<p>Bewick’s humour occasionally verges on positive grossness, and a
<i>glaring</i> instance of his want of delicacy presents itself in the
tail-piece at page 285. After the work was printed off Bewick became
aware that the nakedness of a prominent part of his subject required to
be covered, and one of his apprentices was employed to blacken it over
with ink. In the next edition a plug was inserted in the block, and the
representation of two bars of wood engraved upon it to hide the
offensive part. The cut, however, even thus amended, is still extremely
indelicate.<a class = "tag" name = "tagVII58" id = "tagVII58" href =
"#noteVII58">VII.58</a></p>

<p>The following is a copy of the head-piece at the commencement of the
advertisement to the second volume. It represents an old man saying
grace with closed eyes, while his cat avails herself of the opportunity
of making free with his porridge. The Reverend Henry Cotes, vicar of
Bedlington, happening to call on Bewick when he was finishing this cut,
expressed his disapprobation of the subject, as having a tendency to
ridicule the practice of an act of devotion; but Bewick denied that he
had any such intention, and would not consent to omit the cut. He drew a
distinction between the act and the performer; and though he might
approve of saying grace before meat, he could not help laughing at one
of the over-righteous, who, while craving a blessing with hypocritical
grimace, and with eyes closed to outward things, loses a present good.
The head-piece to the contents presents an excellent sketch of an old
man going to market on a windy and rainy day. The old horse on which he
is mounted has become restive, and the rider has both broken his stick
and lost his hat. The horse seems determined not to move till it suits
his own pleasure; and it is evident that the old man dare not get down
to recover his hat, for, should he do so, encumbered as
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page501" id = "page501">

he is with a heavy basket over his left arm and an egg-pannier slung
over his shoulder, he will not be able to remount.</p>

<p>The following are the principal tail-pieces drawn and engraved by
Bewick himself in the first edition of the second volume of the Birds,
1804. A&nbsp;shooter with a gun at his back crossing a stream on long
stilts, page&nbsp;5. An old wooden-legged beggar gnawing a bone near the
entrance to a gentleman’s house, and a dog beside him eagerly watching
for the reversion, page 27. A&nbsp;dog with a kettle tied to his tail,
pursued by boys,&mdash;a great hulking fellow, evidently a blacksmith,
standing with folded arms enjoying the sport, page 56. A&nbsp;man
crossing a frozen stream, with a branch of a tree between his legs, to
support him should the ice happen to break, page 85. A&nbsp;monkey
basting a goose that is seen roasting, page 263. An old woman with a
pitcher, driving away some geese from a well, page 291. An old
beggar-woman assailed by a gander, page 313.</p>

<p>One of the best of the tail-pieces subsequently inserted is that
which occurs at the end of the description of the Moor-buzzard, volume
I.&nbsp;in the editions of 1816 and 1821, and at page 31 in the edition
of 1832. It represents two dyers carrying a tub between them by means of
a cowl-staff; and the figures, Mr. Atkinson says, are portraits of two
old men belonging to Ovingham,&mdash;“the one on the right being ‘auld
Tommy Dobson of the Bleach Green,’ and the other ‘Mat. Carr.’”<a class =
"tag" name = "tagVII59" id = "tagVII59" href = "#noteVII59">VII.59</a>
The action of the men is excellent, and their expression is in perfect
accordance with the business in which they are engaged&mdash;to wit,
carrying their tub full of <i>chemmerly</i>&mdash;chamber-lye&mdash;to
the dye-house. The olfactory organs of both are evidently affected by
the pungent odour of their load. It may be necessary to observe that the
dyers of Ovingham had at that time a general reservoir in the village,
to which most of the cottagers were contributors; but as each family had
the privilege of supplying themselves from it with as much as they
required for scouring and washing, it sometimes happened that the dyers
found their trough empty, and were consequently obliged to solicit a
supply from such persons as kept a private stock of their own. As they
were both irritable old men, the phrase, “He’s like a <i>raised</i>
[enraged] dyer begging <i>chemmerly</i>,” became proverbial in Ovingham
to denote a person in a passion. This cut, as I am informed by one of
Bewick’s old pupils, was copied on the block and engraved by Luke
Clennell from a water-colour drawing by Robert Johnson.</p>

<p>When the second volume of the History of British Birds was published,
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page502" id = "page502">
502</a></span>
in 1804, Bewick had reached his fiftieth year; but though his powers as
a wood engraver continued for long afterwards unimpaired, yet he
subsequently produced nothing to extend his fame. The retouching of the
blocks for the repeated editions of the Quadrupeds and the Birds, and
the engraving of new cuts for the latter work, occupied a considerable
part of his time. He also engraved, by himself and pupils, several cuts
for different works, but they are generally such as add nothing to his
reputation. Bewick never engraved with pleasure from another person’s
drawing; in large cuts, consisting chiefly of human figures, he did not
excel. His excellence consisted in the representation of animals and in
landscape. The Fables, which had been projected previous to 1795, also
occasionally occupied his attention. This work, which first appeared in
1818, was by no means so favourably received as the Quadrupeds and the
Birds; and several of Bewick’s greatest admirers, who had been led to
expect something better, openly expressed their disappointment. Dr.
Dibdin, speaking of the Fables, says, “It would be a species of
<i>scandalum magnatum</i> to depreciate any production connected with
the name of Bewick; but I will fearlessly and honestly aver that his
Æsop disappointed me; the more so, as his Birds and Beasts are volumes
perfectly classical of their kind.” The disappointment, however, that
was felt with respect to this work resulted perhaps rather from people
expecting too much than from any deficiency in the cuts as
<i>illustrations of Fables</i>. There is a great difference between
representing birds and beasts in their natural character, and
representing them as actors in imaginary scenes. We do not regard the
cock and the fox holding an imaginary conversation, however ably
represented, with the interest with which we look upon each when
faithfully depicted in its proper character. The tail-piece of the bitch
seeing her drowned puppies, at page 364 of the Quadrupeds, edition 1824,
is far more interesting than any cut illustrative of a fable in
Æsop;&mdash;we at once feel its truth, and admire it, because it is
natural. Birds and beasts represented as performing human characters can
never interest so much as when naturally depicted in their own. Such
cuts may display great fancy and much skill on the part of the artist,
but they never can excite true feeling. The martyr Cock Robin, killed by
that malicious archer the Sparrow, is not so interesting as plain Robin
Redbreast picking up crumbs at a cottage-door in the snow:&mdash;</p>

<p class = "verse">
“One touch of nature makes the whole world kin.”</p>

<p>Whatever may be the merits or defects of the cuts in those Fables,
Bewick most certainly had very little to do with them; for by far the
greater number were designed by Robert Johnson, and engraved by
W.&nbsp;W. Temple and William Harvey, while yet in their apprenticeship.
In
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page503" id = "page503">
503</a></span>
the whole volume there are not more than three of the largest cuts
engraved by Bewick himself.<a class = "tag" name = "tagVII60" id =
"tagVII60" href = "#noteVII60">VII.60</a> The tail-pieces in this work
will not bear a comparison with those in the Birds; the subjects are
often both trite and tamely treated; the devil and the
gallows&mdash;Bewick’s two stock-pieces&mdash;occur rather too
frequently, considering that the book is chiefly intended for the
improvement of young minds; and in many instances nature has been
sacrificed in order that the moral might be obvious.</p>

<p class = "caption">
THE CROW AND THE LAMB.</p>

<p>The letter-press was entirely selected and arranged by Bewick
himself, and one or two of the fables were of his own writing. Though an
excellent illustrator of Natural History, Bewick is but an indifferent
fabulist.<a class = "tag" name = "tagVII61" id = "tagVII61" href =
"#noteVII61">VII.61</a> Though the work is professedly intended for the
instruction of the young, there are certainly a few tail-pieces
introduced for the <i>entertainment</i> of the more advanced in years;
and of this kind is the old beggar and his trull lying asleep, and a
bull looking over a rail at them. The explanation of this subject would
certainly have little tendency to improve young minds. Bewick, though
very fond of introducing the devil in his cuts to frighten the wicked,
does not appear to have been willing that a ranting preacher should in
his discourses avail himself of the same character, though to effect the
same purpose, as we learn from the following anecdote related by Mr.
Atkinson. “Cant and hypocrisy he (Bewick) very much disliked.
A&nbsp;ranter took up his abode near Cherry-burn, and used daily to
horrify the country people with very familiar details of ultra-stygian
proceedings. Bewick went to hear him, and after listening patiently for
some time to
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page504" id = "page504">
504</a></span>
a blasphemous recital of such horrors, at which the poor people were
gaping with affright, he got behind the holder-forth, and pinching his
elbow, addressed him when he turned round with great solemnity: ‘Now
then thou seems to know a great deal about the devil, and has been
frightening us a long while about him: can thou tell me whether he wears
his own hair or a wig?’”&mdash;This is a bad joke;&mdash;the query might
have been retorted with effect. The engraver, it seems, might introduce
his Satanic majesty <i>ad libitum</i> in his cuts; but when a ranting
preacher takes the same liberty in his discourses, he is called upon to
give proof of personal acquaintance.</p>

<p>Bewick’s morality was rather rigid than cheerful; and he was but too
prone to think uncharitably of others, whose conduct and motives, when
weighed in the scales of impartial justice, were perhaps as correct and
as pure as his own. His good men are often represented as somewhat cold,
selfish individuals, with little sympathy for the more unfortunate of
their species, whose errors are as often the result of ignorance as of a
positively vicious character. As a moralist, he was accustomed to look
at the dark rather than the bright side of human nature, and hence his
tendency to brand those with whom he might differ in opinion as fools
and knaves. One of the fables, written by himself, was objected to by
the printer, the late Mr. E.&nbsp;Walker, and at his request it was
omitted. We give a copy of the cut intended for it. The world is
represented as having lost its balance, and legions of his favourite
devils are seen hurled about in a confused vortex. The fable, it is
said, was intended as a satire on
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page505" id = "page505">
505</a></span>
the ministerial politics of the time. A&nbsp;thumb-mark is seen at the
upper end of what is intended to represent a piece of paper forming part
of the page of a Bible pasted across the cut. A&nbsp;similar mark is to
be found at page 175 of the Land Birds, first edition, 1797, and in the
bill and receipt prefixed to the Fables, 1818-1823.</p>

<p class = "illustration">

<p>In a novel, entitled “Such is the World,” there is the following
erroneous account of Bewick’s reason for affixing his thumb-mark to this
bill.<a class = "tag" name = "tagVII62" id = "tagVII62" href =
"#noteVII62">VII.62</a> “Having completed his task to the entire
satisfaction of his own mind, Mr. Bewick bethought him of engraving a
frontispiece. But having some suspicion that the said frontispiece might
be pirated by some of those corsairs who infest the ocean of literature,
he resolved to put a mark on it, whereby all men might distinguish it as
readily as a fisherman distinguishes a haddock<a class = "tag" name =
"tagVII63" id = "tagVII63" href = "#noteVII63">VII.63</a> from a
cod-fish. Accordingly, he touched with his thumb the little black ball
with which he was wont to ink his cuts, in order to take off proof
impressions of his work: he then very deliberately pressed his thumb on
the frontispiece which he was at that moment engraving, and cut the most
beautiful image of the original, which he designated by the appropriate
words ‘John Bewick, his mark.’” Had the writer looked at the
“frontispiece,” as he calls it, he would have found “<i>Thomas</i>,” and
not “<i>John</i>.” The conclusion of this account is a fair sample of
its general accuracy. In a preliminary observation the author, with
equal correctness, informs his readers that the work in which this
“frontispiece” appeared was “a&nbsp;superb edition of <i>Gay’s</i>
Fables.”</p>

<p>Bewick’s <i>mark</i> is, in fact, added to this bill merely as a
jest; the mode which he took to authenticate the copies that were
actually issued by himself, and not pilfered by any of the workmen
employed about the printing-office,<a class = "tag" name = "tagVII64" id
= "tagVII64" href = "#noteVII64">VII.64</a> was to print at his own
work-shop, in red ink from a copper-plate, a&nbsp;representation of a
piece of sea-weed lying above the wood-cut which had previously been
printed off at a printing-office. This mode of printing a copper-plate
over a wood-cut was a part of
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page506" id = "page506">
506</a></span>
one of the plans which he had devised to prevent the forgery of
bank-notes.<a class = "tag" name = "tagVII65" id = "tagVII65" href =
"#noteVII65">VII.65</a></p>

<p>The first of the two following cuts, copied from his Fables, records
the decease of Bewick’s mother, who died on the 20th of February 1785,
aged 58; and the second that of his father, who died on the 15th of
November in the same year, aged 70. The last event also marks the day on
which he began to engrave the first cut intended for the Quadrupeds.
This cut was the Arabian Camel, or Dromedary, and he had made very
little progress with it when a messenger arrived from Cherry-burn to
inform him of his father’s death.</p>

<p>Several years previous to his decease Bewick had devised an
improvement, which consisted in printing a subject from two or more
blocks,&mdash;not in the manner of chiaro-scuros, but in order to obtain
a greater variety of <i>tint</i>, and a better effect than could be
obtained, without great labour, in a cut printed in black ink from a
single block. This improvement, which had been suggested by Papillon in
1768, Bewick proceeded to carry into effect. The subject which he made
choice of to exemplify what he considered his original discovery, was an
old horse waiting for death.<a class = "tag" name = "tagVII66" id =
"tagVII66" href = "#noteVII66">VII.66</a> He accordingly made the
drawing on a large block consisting of four different pieces, and
forthwith proceeded to engrave it. He however did not live to complete
his intention; for even this block, which he meant merely for the first
impression&mdash;the subject having to be completed by a
second&mdash;remained unfinished at his decease.<a class = "tag" name =
"tagVII67" id = "tagVII67" href = "#noteVII67">VII.67</a> He had,
however, finished it all
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page507" id = "page507">
507</a></span>
with the exception of part of the horse’s head, and when in this state
he had four impressions taken about a week before his death. It was on
this occasion that he exclaimed, when the pressman handed him the proof,
“I&nbsp;wish I was but twenty years younger!”</p>

<p>This cut, with the head said to have been finished by another person,
was published by Bewick’s son, Mr. Robert Elliott Bewick, in 1832. It is
the largest cut that Bewick ever engraved,<a class = "tag" name =
"tagVII68" id = "tagVII68" href = "#noteVII68">VII.68</a> but having
been left by him in an unfinished state, it would be impossible to say
what he might have effected had he lived to work out his ideas, and
unfair to judge of it as if it were a finished performance. It is,
however, but just to remark, that the miserable appearance of the poor,
worn-out, neglected animal, is represented with great feeling and
truth,&mdash;excepting the head, which is disproportionately large and
heavy,&mdash;and that the landscape displays Bewick’s usual fidelity in
copying nature.</p>

<p>Bewick’s life affords a useful lesson to all who wish to attain
distinction in art, and at the same time to preserve their independence.
He diligently cultivated his talents, and never trusted to booksellers
or designers for employment. He did not work according to the directions
of others, but struck out a path for himself; and by diligently pursuing
it according to the bent of his own feelings, he acquired both a
competence with respect to worldly means and an ample reward of fame.
The success of his works did not render him inattentive to business; and
he was never tempted by the prospect of increasing wealth to indulge in
expensive pleasures, nor to live in a manner which his circumstances did
not warrant. What he had honestly earned he frugally husbanded; and,
like a prudent man, made a provision for his old age. “The hand of the
diligent,” says Solomon, “maketh rich.” This Bewick felt, and his life
may be cited in the exemplification of the truth of the proverb. He
acquired not indeed great wealth, but he attained a competence, and was
grateful and contented. No favoured worshipper of Mammon, though
possessed of millions obtained by “watching the turn of the market,”
could say more.</p>

<p>He was extremely regular and methodical in his habits of business:
until within a few years of his death he used to come to his shop in
Newcastle from his house in Gateshead at a certain hour in the morning,
returning to his dinner at a certain time, and, as he used to say,
<i>lapping
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page508" id = "page508">
508</a></span>
up</i> at night, as if he were a workman employed by the day, and
subject to a loss by being absent a single hour. When any of his works
were in the press, the first thing he did each morning, after calling at
his own shop, was to proceed to the printer’s to see what progress they
were making, and to give directions to the pressmen about printing the
cuts.<a class = "tag" name = "tagVII69" id = "tagVII69" href =
"#noteVII69">VII.69</a> It is indeed owing to his attention in this
respect that the cuts in all the editions of his works published during
his life-time are so well printed. The edition of the Birds, published
in 1832, displays numerous instances of the want of Bewick’s own
superintendence: either through the carelessness or ignorance of the
pressmen, many of the cuts are quite spoiled.</p>

<p>The following cut represents a view of Bewick’s workshop in St.
Nicholas’ Churchyard, Newcastle. The upper room, the two windows of
which are seen in the roof, was that in which he worked in the latter
years of his life. In this shop he engraved the cuts which will
perpetuate his name; and there for upwards of fifty years was he
accustomed to sit, steadily and cheerfully pursuing the labour that he
loved. He used always to work with his hat on; and when any gentleman or
nobleman
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page509" id = "page509">
509</a></span>
called upon him, he only removed it for a moment on his first entering.
He used frequently to whistle when at work, and he was seldom without a
large quid of tobacco in his mouth. The prominence occasioned by the
quid, which he kept between his under lip and his teeth, and not in his
cheek, is indicated in most of his portraits.</p>

<p>A stick, which had been his brother John’s, was a great favourite
with him, and he generally carried it in his walks, always carefully
putting it in a certain place when he entered his workroom. He used to
be very partial to a draught of water in the afternoon, immediately
before leaving work. The water was brought fresh by one of the
apprentices from the <i>pant</i> at the head of the Side, in an
earthenware jug, and the glass which Bewick used to drink the water out
of, was, as soon as done with, carefully locked up in his book-case. One
of his apprentices once happening to break the jug, Bewick scolded him
well for his carelessness, and made him pay twopence towards buying
another.</p>

<p>Bewick was a man of athletic make, being nearly six feet high, and
proportionally stout. He possessed great personal courage, and in his
younger days was not slow to repay an insult with personal chastisement.
On one occasion being assaulted by two pitmen on returning from a visit
to Cherry-burn, he resolutely turned upon the aggressors, and, as he
said, “<i>paid</i> them both well.” Though hard-featured, and much
marked with the small-pox, the expression of Bewick’s countenance was
manly and open, and his dark eyes sparkled with intelligence. There is a
good bust of him by Bailey in the Library of the Literary and
Philosophical Society of Newcastle, and the best engraved portrait is
perhaps that of Burnet, after a painting by Ramsey.<a class = "tag" name
= "tagVII70" id = "tagVII70" href = "#noteVII70">VII.70</a> The portrait
on page 510, engraved on wood, is another attempt to perpetuate the
likeness of one to whom the art owes so much.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1828 Bewick visited London; but he was then
evidently in a declining state of health, and he had lost much of his
former energy of mind. Scarcely anything that he saw interested him, and
he longed no less than in his younger years to return to the banks of
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page510" id = "page510">
510</a></span>
the Tyne. He had ceased to feel an interest in objects which formerly
afforded him great pleasure; for when his old friend, the late Mr.
William Bulmer, drove him round the Regent’s Park, he declined to alight
for the purpose of visiting the collection of animals in the Gardens of
the Zoological Society.</p>

<p>On his return to Newcastle he appeared for a short time to enjoy his
usual health and spirits. On the Saturday preceding his death he took
the block of the Old Horse waiting for Death to the printer’s, and had
it proved; on the following Monday he became unwell, and after a few
days’ illness he ceased to exist. He died at his house on the
Windmill-hills, Gateshead, on the 8th of November, 1828, aged
seventy-five. He was buried at Ovingham, and the following cut

<p>In an excellent notice of the works of Bewick&mdash;apparently
written by one of his townsmen (said to be Mr.
T.&nbsp;Doubleday)&mdash;in Blackwood’s Magazine for July, 1825, it is
stated that the final tail-piece to Bewick’s Fables, 1818-1823, is
“A&nbsp;View of Ovingham Churchyard;” and in the Reverend William
Turner’s Memoir of Thomas Bewick, in the sixth volume of the
Naturalist’s Library, the same statement is repeated. It is, however,
erroneous; as both the writers might have known had they thought it
worth their while to pay a visit to Ovingham, and take a look
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page512" id = "page512">
512</a></span>
at the church. The following cut, in which is introduced an imaginary
representation of Bewick’s funeral, presents a correct view of the
place. The following popular saying, which is well known in
Northumberland, suggested the introduction of the rain-bow:</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p class = "open">“Happy is the bride that the sun shines on,</p>
<p>And happy is the corpse that the rain rains on,&mdash;”</p>
</div>

<p class = "continue">
meaning that sunshine at a wedding is a sign of happiness in the
marriage state to the bride, and that rain at a funeral is a sign of
future happiness to the person whose remains are about to be
interred.</p>

<p>The following eloquent tribute to the merits of Bewick is from an

spirit, gurgling from the Crawley Spring so many thousand gallons of the

it rather oozes out from unnumbered springs. Here from one scarcely

trickles away into a little mountain rill&mdash;here leaping into sudden
life, as from the rock&mdash;here bubbling from a silver pool,

day, with a few words from Scripture, or some rude engraving, religious
as Scripture, <span class = "smallcaps">Omne bonum desuper&mdash;Opera

<p>John Bewick, a younger brother of Thomas, was born at Cherry-burn in
1760, and in 1777 was apprenticed as a wood engraver to his brother and
Mr. Beilby. He undoubtedly assisted his brother in the execution of the
cuts for the two editions of Fables, printed by Mr. Saint in 1779 and
1784; but in those early productions it would be impossible, judging
merely from the style of the engraving, to distinguish the work of the
two brothers. Among the earliest cuts known to have been engraved by
John Bewick, on the expiration of his apprenticeship, are those
contained in a work entitled “Emblems of Mortality,” printed in 1789 for
T.&nbsp;Hodgson, the publisher of the Hieroglyphic Bible, mentioned at
page 478. Those cuts, which are very indifferently executed, are copies,
occasionally altered for the worse, of the cuts in Holbein’s Dance of
Death. Whether he engraved them in London, or not, I&nbsp;have been
unable to ascertain; but it is certain that he was living in London in
the following year, and that he resided there till 1795. When residing
in the metropolis he drew and engraved the cuts for “The Progress of Man
and Society,” compiled by Dr. Trusler, and published in 1791; the cuts
for “The Looking Glass of the Mind,” 1796; and also those contained in a
similar work entitled “Blossoms of Morality,” published about the same
time. Though several of those cuts display considerable talent, yet the
best specimens of his abilities as a designer and engraver on wood are
to be found in Poems by Goldsmith and Parnell, 1795, and in Somervile’s
Chase, 1796, both printed in quarto, to display the excellence of modern
printing, type-founding, wood-engraving, and paper-making. Mr. Bulmer,
who suggested those editions, being himself a Northumbrian, had been
intimately acquainted with both Thomas and John Bewick. In the preface
to the Poems by Goldsmith and Parnell, he is careful to commemorate the
paper-maker, type-founder, and the engravers; but he omits to mention
the name of Robert Johnson, who designed three of the principal
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page514" id = "page514">
514</a></span>
cuts.<a class = "tag" name = "tagVII72" id = "tagVII72" href =
"#noteVII72">VII.72</a> The merits of this highly-talented young man
appear to have been singularly overlooked by those whose more especial
duty it was to notice them. In the whole of Bewick’s works he is not
once mentioned. Mr. Bulmer also says, that all the cuts were engraved by
Thomas and John Bewick; but though he unquestionably believed so
himself, the statement is not strictly correct; for the four vignette
head and tail-pieces to the Traveller and the Deserted Village were
engraved by C.&nbsp;Nesbit. The vignettes on the title-pages, the large
cut of the old woman gathering water-cresses, and the tail-piece at the
end of the volume, were drawn and engraved by John Bewick; the remainder
were engraved by Thomas.</p>

<p>The cuts in this book are generally executed in a free and effective
style, but are not remarkable as specimens of wood engraving, unless we
take into consideration the time when they were published. The best in
point of execution are, The Hermit at his morning devotion, and The
Angel, Hermit, and Guide, both engraved by Thomas Bewick; the manner in
which the engraver has executed the foliage in these two cuts is
extremely beautiful and natural. It is said that George III. thought so
highly of the cuts in this book that he could not believe that they were
engraved on wood; and that his bookseller, Mr. George Nicol, obtained
for his Majesty a sight of the blocks in order that he might be
convinced of the fact by his own inspection. This anecdote is sometimes
produced as a proof of the great excellence of the cuts, though it might
with greater truth be cited as a proof of his Majesty being totally
unacquainted with the process of wood engraving, and of his not being
able to distinguish a wood-cut from a copper-plate. If Bewick’s
reputation as a wood engraver rested on those cuts, it certainly would
not stand very high. Much better things of the same kind have been
executed since that time by persons who are generally considered as
having small claims to distinction as wood engravers.</p>

<p>The cuts in the Chase were all, except one, designed by John Bewick;
but in consequence of the declining state of his health he was not able
to engrave them. Soon after he had finished the drawings on the block he
left London for the north, in the hope of deriving benefit from his
native air. His disorder, however, continued to increase; and, within a
few weeks from the time of his return, he died at Ovingham, on the 5th
of December, 1795, aged thirty-five.</p>

<p>The cuts in the Chase, which were all, except one, engraved by Thomas
Bewick, are, on the whole, superior in point of execution to those in
the Poems of Goldsmith and Parnell. Though boldly designed, some of them
display great defects in composition, and among the most objectionable
in this respect are the Huntsman and three Hounds, at
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page515" id = "page515">
515</a></span>
page 5; the conclusion of the Chase, page 31; and George III.
stag-hunting, page 93. Among the best, both as respects design and
execution, are: Morning, vignette on title-page, remarkably spirited;
Hounds, page 25; a&nbsp;Stag drinking, page 27; Fox-hunting, page 63;
and Otter-hunting, page 99. The final tail-piece, which has been spoiled
in the engraving, was executed by one of Bewick’s pupils.</p>

<p>John Bewick, as a designer and engraver on wood, is much inferior to
his brother. Though several of his cuts possess considerable merit with
respect to design, by far the greater number are executed in a dry,
harsh manner. His best cuts may be readily distinguished from his
brother’s by the greater contrast of black and white in the cuts
engraved by John, and by the dry and withered appearance of the foliage
of the trees. The above is a reduced copy of a cut entitled the “Sad
Historian,” drawn and engraved by John Bewick, in the Poems by Goldsmith
and Parnell.</p>

<p>The most of John Bewick’s cuts are much better conceived than
engraved; and this perhaps may in a great measure have arisen from
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page516" id = "page516">
516</a></span>
their having been chiefly executed for children’s books, in which
excellence of engraving was not required. His style of engraving is not
good; for though some of his cuts are extremely <i>effective</i> from
the contrast of light and shade, yet the lines in almost every one are
coarse and harsh, and “laid in,” to use a technical expression, in a
hard and tasteless manner. Dry, stiff, parallel lines, scarcely ever
deviating into a pleasing curve, are the general characteristic of most
of his small cuts. As he reached the age of thirty-five without having
produced any cut which displays much ability in the execution, it is not
likely that he would have excelled as a wood engraver had his life been
prolonged. The following is a fac-simile of one of the best of his cuts
in the Blossoms of Morality, published about 1796. It exemplifies his
manner of strongly contrasting positive black with pure white; and the
natural attitudes of the women afford a tolerably fair specimen of his
talents as a designer.</p>

<p>Robert Johnson, though not a wood engraver, has a claim to a brief
notice here on account of the excellence of several of the tail-pieces
designed by him in Bewick’s Birds, and from his having made the drawings
for most of the wood-cuts in Bewick’s Fables. He was born in 1770, at
Shotley, a&nbsp;village in Northumberland, about six miles to the
south-west of Ovingham; and in 1778 was placed by his father, who at
that time resided in Gateshead, as an apprentice to Beilby and Bewick to
be instructed in copper-plate engraving. The plates which are generally
supposed to have been executed by him during his apprenticeship possess
very little merit, nor does he appear to have been desirous to excel as
an engraver. His great delight consisted in sketching from nature and in
painting in water-colours; and in this branch of art, while yet an
apprentice, he displayed talents of very high order.<a class = "tag"
name = "tagVII73" id = "tagVII73" href = "#noteVII73">VII.73</a> He
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page517" id = "page517">
517</a></span>
was frequently employed by his master in drawing and making designs, and
at his leisure hours he took every opportunity of improving himself in
his favourite art. The Earl of Bute happening to call at Beilby and
Bewick’s shop on one occasion when passing through Newcastle,
a&nbsp;portfolio of Johnson’s drawings, made at his leisure hours, was
shown to his lordship, who was so much pleased with them that he
selected as many as amounted to forty pounds. This sum Beilby and Bewick
appropriated to themselves, on the ground that, as he was their
apprentice, those drawings, as well as any others that he might make,
were legally their property. Johnson’s friends, however, thinking
differently, instituted legal proceedings for the recovery of the money,
and obtained a decision in their favour. One of the pleas set up by
Beilby and Bewick was, that the drawings properly belonged to them, as
they taught him the art, and that the making of such drawings was part
of his business. This plea, however, failed; it was elicited on the
examination of one of their own apprentices, Charlton Nesbit, that
neither he nor any other of his fellow apprentices was taught the art of
drawing in water-colours by their masters, and that it formed no part of
their necessary instruction as engravers.</p>

<p>On the expiration of his apprenticeship Johnson gave up, in a great
measure, the practice of copper-plate engraving, and applied himself
almost exclusively to drawing. In 1796 he was engaged by Messrs.
Morison, booksellers and publishers of Perth, to draw from the original
paintings the portraits intended to be engraved in “the Scottish
Gallery,” a&nbsp;work edited by Pinkerton, and published about 1799.
When at Taymouth Castle, the seat of the Earl of Breadalbane, copying
some portraits painted by Jameson, the Scottish Vandyke, he caught a
severe cold, which, being neglected, increased to a fever. In the
violence of the disorder he became delirious, and, from the ignorance of
those who attended him, the unfortunate young artist, far from home and
without a friend to console him, was bound and treated like a madman.
A&nbsp;physician having been called in, by his order blisters were
applied, and a different course of treatment adopted. Johnson recovered
his senses, but it was only for a brief period; being of a delicate
constitution, he sank under the disorder. He died at Kenmore on the 29th
October, 1796, in the twenty-sixth year of his age.<a class = "tag" name

<p>The following is a copy of a cut&mdash;from a design by Johnson

<p>Charlton Nesbit, who is justly entitled to be ranked with the best
wood engravers of his time, was born in 1775 at Swalwell, in the county
of Durham, about five miles westward of Gateshead, and when about
fourteen years of age was apprenticed to Beilby and Bewick to learn the
art of wood engraving. During his apprenticeship he engraved a few of
the tail-pieces in the first volume of the History of British Birds, and
all the head and tail-pieces, except two, in the Poems by Goldsmith and
Parnell, printed by Bulmer in 1795. Shortly after the expiration of his
apprenticeship he began to engrave a large cut, containing a view of St.
Nicholas Church, Newcastle-on-Tyne, from a drawing by his fellow-pupil,
Robert Johnson. We here present a reduced copy of this cut, which is one
of the largest ever engraved in England.<a class = "tag" name =
"tagVII75" id = "tagVII75" href = "#noteVII75">VII.75</a> The original
was engraved on a block consisting of twelve different pieces of box,
firmly cramped together, and mounted on a plate of cast iron to prevent
their warping. For this cut, which was first published about 1799, Mr.
Nesbit received a medal from the Society for the Encouragement of Arts
and Manufactures.</p>

<img src = "images/illus_519.png" width = "335" height = "252"

<p>About 1799 Mr. Nesbit came to London, where he continued to reside
till 1815. During his residence there he engraved a number of cuts for
various works, chiefly from the designs of the late Mr. John Thurston,<a
class = "tag" name = "tagVII76" id = "tagVII76" href =
"#noteVII76">VII.76</a>
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page520" id = "page520">
520</a></span>
who at that time was the principal, and indeed almost the only artist of
any talent in London, who made drawings on the block for wood engravers.
Some of the best of his cuts executed during this period are to be found
in a History of England printed for R.&nbsp;Scholey, and in a work
entitled Religious Emblems, published by R.&nbsp;Ackermann and Co. in
1808. The cuts in the latter work were engraved by Nesbit, Clennell,
Branston, and Hole, from drawings by Thurston; and they are
unquestionably the best of their kind which up to that time had appeared
in England. Clennell’s are the most artist-like in their execution and
effect, while Nesbit’s are engraved with greater care. Branston, except
in one cut,&mdash;Rescued from the Floods,&mdash;does not appear to such
advantage in this work as his northern rivals. There is only one
cut&mdash;Seed sown&mdash;engraved by Hole. The following may be
mentioned as the best of Nesbit’s cuts in this work:&mdash;The World
Weighed, The Daughters of Jerusalem, Sinners hiding in the Grave, and
Wounded in the Mental Eye. The best of Clennell’s are:&mdash;Call to
Vigilance, the World made Captive, and Fainting for the Living Waters.
These are perhaps the three best cuts of their kind that Clennell ever
engraved.</p>

<p>In 1815 Mr. Nesbit returned to his native place, where he continued
to reside until 1830. While living in the country, though he did not
abandon the art, yet the cuts executed by him during this period are
comparatively few. In 1818, when residing in the North, he engraved a
large cut of Rinaldo and Armida for Savage’s Hints on Decorative
Printing: this cut and another, the Cave of Despair, in the same work
and of the same size, engraved by the late Robert Branston, were
expressly given to display the perfection to which modern wood engraving
had been brought. The foliage, the trees, and the drapery in Nesbit’s
cut are admirably engraved; but the lines in the bodies of the figures
are too much broken and “<i>chopped up</i>.” This, however, was not the
fault of the engraver, but of the designer, Mr. J.&nbsp;Thurston. The
lines, which now have a dotted appearance, were originally continuous
and distinct; but Mr. Thurston objecting to them as being too dark,
Nesbit went over his work again, and with immense labour reduced the
strength of his lines, and gave them their present dotted appearance. As
a specimen of the engraver’s abilities, the first proof submitted to the
designer was superior to the last.</p>

<p>In order to give a fictitious value to Mr. Savage’s book, most of the
cuts, as soon as a certain number of impressions were taken, were sawn
across, but not through, in several places, and impressions of them when
thus defaced were given in the work.<a class = "tag" name = "tagVII77"
id = "tagVII77" href = "#noteVII77">VII.77</a> Nesbit’s cut was,
however,
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page521" id = "page521">
521</a></span>
carefully repaired, and the back part of Armida’s head having been
altered, the impressions from the block thus amended were actually given
in the work itself as the <i>best</i>, instead of those which were taken
before it was defaced. This re-integration of the block was the work of
the late Mr. G.&nbsp;W. Bonner, Mr. Branston’s nephew. The transverse
pieces are so skilfully inserted, and engraved so much in the style of
the adjacent parts, that it is difficult to discover where the defacing
saw had passed.</p>

<p>In 1830 Mr. Nesbit returned to London, where he continued to reside
until his death, which took place at Queen’s Elms, the 11th of November
1838, aged 63. Some of the best of his cuts are contained in the second
series of Northcote’s Fables; and the following, of his execution, may
be ranked among the finest productions of the art of wood engraving in
modern times:&mdash;The Robin and the Sparrow, page&nbsp;1; The Hare and
the Bramble, page 127; The Peach and the Potatoe, page 129; and The
Cock, the Dog, and the Fox, page 238. Nesbit is unquestionably the best
wood engraver that has proceeded from the great northern hive of the
art&mdash;the workshop of Thomas Bewick.</p>

<p>Luke Clennell, one of the most distinguished of Bewick’s pupils as a
designer and painter, as well as an engraver on wood, was born at
Ulgham, a&nbsp;village near Morpeth, in Northumberland, on the 8th of
April, 1781. At an early age he was placed with a relation,
a&nbsp;grocer in Morpeth, and continued with him, assisting in the shop
as an apprentice, until he was sixteen. Some drawings which he made when
at Morpeth having attracted attention, and he himself showing a decided
predilection for the art, his friends were induced to place him as a
wood engraver with Bewick, to whom he was bound apprentice for seven
years on the 8th of April, 1797. He in a short time made great
proficiency in wood engraving; and as he drew with great correctness and
power, Bewick employed him to copy, on the block, several of Robert
Johnson’s drawings, and to engrave them as tail-pieces for the second
volume of the History of British Birds. Clennell for a few months after
the expiration of his apprenticeship continued to work for Bewick, who
chiefly employed him in engraving some of the cuts for a History of
England, published by Wallis and Scholey, 46, Paternoster Row. Clennell,
who was paid only two guineas apiece for each of those cuts, having
learnt that Bewick received five, sent to the publisher a proof of one
of them&mdash;Alfred in the Danish Camp&mdash;stating that it was of his
own engraving. In the course of a few days Clennell received an answer
from the publisher, inviting him to come to London, and offering him
employment
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page522" id = "page522">
522</a></span>
until all the cuts intended for the work should be finished. He accepted
the offer, and shortly afterwards set out for London, where he arrived
about the end of autumn, 1804.<a class = "tag" name = "tagVII78" id =
"tagVII78" href = "#noteVII78">VII.78</a></p>

<p>Most of Clennell’s cuts are distinguished by their free and
<i>artist-like</i> execution and by their excellent effect; but though
generally spirited, they are sometimes rather coarsely engraved. He was
accustomed to improve Thurston’s designs by occasionally heightening the
effect.<a class = "tag" name = "tagVII79" id = "tagVII79" href =
"#noteVII79">VII.79</a> To such alterations Thurston at first objected;
but perceiving that the cuts when engraved were thus very much improved,
he afterwards allowed Clennell to increase the lights and deepen the
shadows according to his own judgment. An admirable specimen of
Clennell’s engraving is to be found in an octavo edition of Falconer’s
Shipwreck, printed for Cadell and Davies, 1808. It occurs as a vignette
to the second canto at p.&nbsp;43, and the subject is a ship running
before the wind in a gale. The motion of the waves, and the gloomy
appearance of the sky, are represented with admirable truth and feeling.
The dark shadow on the waters to the right gives wonderful effect to the
white crest of the wave in front; and the whole appearance of the cut is
indicative of a gloomy and tempestuous day, and of an increasing storm.
Perhaps no engraving of the same kind, either on copper or wood, conveys
the idea of a storm at sea with greater fidelity.<a class = "tag" name =
"tagVII80" id = "tagVII80" href = "#noteVII80">VII.80</a> The drawing
was made on the block by Thurston; but the spirit and
<i>effect</i>,&mdash;the lights and shadows, the apparent seething of
the waves, and the troubled appearance of the sky,&mdash;were introduced
by Clennell. All the other cuts in this edition of the Shipwreck are of
his engraving; but though well executed, they do not require any
especial notice. Two of them, which were previously designed for another
work, are certainly not <i>illustrations</i> of Falconer’s
Shipwreck.</p>

DIPLOMA OF THE HIGHLAND SOCIETY<br>
<i>Reduced to one-fourth of the original size</i></p>

<p>Clennell’s largest cut is that which he engraved for the diploma of
the Highland Society, from a design by Benjamin West, President of the
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page523" id = "page523">
523</a></span>
Royal Academy; and for this he received fifty guineas. The original
drawing was made on paper, and Clennell gave Thurston fifteen pounds for
copying on the block the figures within the circle: the supporters,
a&nbsp;Highland soldier and a fisherman, he copied himself. The block on
which he first began to engrave this cut consisted of several pieces of
box veneered upon beech; and after he had been employed upon it for
about two months, it one afternoon suddenly split when he was at tea.
Clennell, hearing it crack, immediately suspected the cause; and on
finding it rent in such a manner that there was no chance of repairing
it, he, in a passion that the labour already bestowed on it should be
lost, threw all the tea-things into the fire. In the course of a few
days however, he got a new block made, consisting of solid pieces of box
firmly screwed and cramped together; and having paid Thurston fifteen
pounds more for re-drawing the figures within the circle, and having
again copied the supporters, he proceeded with renewed spirit to
complete his work. For engraving this cut he received a hundred and
fifty guineas&mdash;he paying Thurston himself for the drawing on the
block; and the Society for the Encouragement of Arts and Manufactures
presented him with their gold medal, May 30, 1809. This cut is
characteristic of Clennell’s style of engraving&mdash;the lines are in
some places coarse, and in
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page524" id = "page524">
524</a></span>
others the execution is careless; the more important parts are, however,
engraved with great spirit; and the cut, as a whole, is bold and
effective. Cross-hatchings are freely introduced, not so much, perhaps,
because they were necessary, as to show that the engraver could execute
such kind of work,&mdash;the vulgar error that cross-hatchings could not
be executed on wood having been at that time extremely prevalent among
persons who had little knowledge of the art, and who yet vented their
absurd notions on the subject as if they were undeniable truths. The
preceding is a reduced copy of this cut.<a class = "tag" name =
"tagVII81" id = "tagVII81" href = "#noteVII81">VII.81</a> The original
block, when only a very limited number of impressions had been printed
off, was burnt in the fire at Mr. Bensley’s printing-office. The subject
was afterwards re-engraved on a block of the same size by John
Thompson.</p>

<p>The illustrations to an edition of Rogers’s Poems, 1812, engraved
from pen-and-ink drawings by Thomas Stothard, R.A., may be fairly ranked
among the best of the wood-cuts engraved by Clennell. They are executed
with the feeling of an artist, and are admirable representations of the
original drawings.<a class = "tag" name = "tagVII82" id = "tagVII82"
href = "#noteVII82">VII.82</a> Stothard himself was much pleased with
them; but he thought that when wood engravers attempted to express more
than a copy of a pen-and-ink drawing, and introduced a variety of tints
in the manner of copper-plate engravings, they exceeded the legitimate
boundaries of the art. A&nbsp;hundred wood-cuts by Bewick, Nesbit,
Clennell, and Thompson might, however, be produced to show that this
opinion was not well founded.</p>

<p>Clennell, who drew beautifully in water-colours, made many of the
drawings for the Border Antiquities; and the encouragement which he
received as a designer and painter made him resolve to entirely abandon
wood engraving. With this view he laboured diligently to improve himself
in painting, and in a short time made such progress that his pictures
attracted the attention of the Directors of the British Institution. In
1814, the Earl of Bridgewater employed him to paint a large picture of
the entertainment given to the Allied Sovereigns in the Guildhall by the
city of London. He experienced great difficulty in obtaining sketches of
the numerous distinguished persons whose portraits it was necessary to
give in the picture; and he lost much time, and suffered considerable
anxiety, in procuring those preliminary materials for his work. Having
at length completed his sketches, he began the picture, and had made
considerable progress in it when, in April 1817, he suddenly became
insane, and the work was interrupted.<a class = "tag" name = "tagVII83"
id = "tagVII83" href = "#noteVII83">VII.83</a> It has
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page525" id = "page525">
525</a></span>
been said that his malady arose from intense application, and from
anxiety respecting the success of his work. This, however, can scarcely
be correct; he had surmounted his greatest difficulties, and was
proceeding regularly and steadily with the painting, when he suddenly
became deprived of his reason. One of his fellow-pupils when he was with
Bewick, who was intimate with him, and was accustomed to see him
frequently, never observed any previous symptom of insanity in his
behaviour, and never heard him express any particular anxiety about the
work on which he was engaged.</p>

<p>Within a short time after Clennell had lost his reason, his wife also
became insane;<a class = "tag" name = "tagVII84" id = "tagVII84" href =
"#noteVII84">VII.84</a> and the malady being accompanied by a fever, she
after a short illness expired, leaving three young children to deplore
the death of one parent and the confirmed insanity of the other. These
most distressing circumstances excited the sympathy of several noblemen
and gentlemen; and a committee having been appointed to consider of the
best means of raising a fund for the support of Clennell’s family, it
was determined to publish by subscription an engraving from one of his
pictures. The subject made choice of was the Decisive Charge of the Life
Guards at Waterloo, for which Clennell had received a reward from the
British Institution. It was engraved by Mr. W.&nbsp;Bromley, and
published in 1821. The sum thus raised was, after paying for the
engraving, vested in trustees for the benefit of Clennell’s children,
and for the purpose of providing a small annuity for himself.</p>

<p>Clennell, after having been confined for three or four years in a
lunatic asylum in London, so far recovered that it was no longer
necessary to keep him in a state of restraint. He was accordingly sent
down to the North, and lived for several years in a state of harmless
insanity with a relation in the neighbourhood of Newcastle; amusing
himself with making drawings, engraving little wood-cuts, and
occasionally writing <i>poetry</i>. Upwards of sixty of those drawings
are now lying before me, displaying at once so much of his former genius
and of his present imbecility that it is not possible to regard them,
knowing whose they are, without a deep feeling of commiseration for his
fate. He used occasionally to call on Bewick, and he once asked for a
block to engrave. Bewick, to humour him, gave him a piece of wood, and
left him to choose his own subject; and Clennell, on his next visit,
brought with him the cut finished: it was like the attempt of a boy when
first beginning to engrave, but he thought it one of the most successful
of his productions in the art. The following specimens of his cuts and
of his poetry were respectively engraved and written in 1828.</p>

<p>About 1831, Clennell having become much worse, his friends were again
compelled to place him under restraint. He was accordingly conveyed to a
lunatic asylum near Newcastle, where he is still living. Until within
this last year or two, he continued to amuse himself with drawing and
writing poetry, and perhaps may do so still. It is to be hoped that,
though his condition appear miserable to us, he is not miserable
himself; that though deprived of the light of reason, he may yet enjoy
imaginary pleasures of which we can form no conception; and that his
confinement occasions to him</p>

<p>William Harvey, another distinguished pupil of Bewick, and one whose
earlier engravings are only surpassed by his more recent productions as
a designer on wood, was born at Newcastle-on-Tyne, 13th of July 1796.
Having from an early age shown great fondness for drawing, he was at the
age of fourteen apprenticed to Thomas Bewick to learn the art of
engraving on wood.<a class = "tag" name = "tagVII86" id = "tagVII86"
href = "#noteVII86">VII.86</a> In conjunction with his fellow-pupil,
W.&nbsp;W. Temple, he engraved most of the cuts in Bewick’s Fables,
1818; and as he excelled in drawing as well as in engraving, he was
generally entrusted by Bewick to make the drawings on the block after
Robert
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page528" id = "page528">
528</a></span>
Johnson’s designs. One of the best cuts engraved by Harvey during his
apprenticeship was a vignette for the title-page of a small work
entitled “Cheviot: a&nbsp;Poetical Fragment,” printed at Newcastle in
1817. This cut, which was also drawn by himself, is extremely beautiful
both in design and execution; the trees and the foliage are in
particular excellently represented; and as a small picturesque subject
it is one of the best he ever engraved.</p>

<p>Harvey was a great favourite of Bewick, who presented him with a copy
of the History of British Birds as a new year’s gift on the 1st of
January 1815, and at the same time addressed to him the following
admonitory letter. Mr. Harvey is a distinguished artist, a&nbsp;kind
son, an affectionate husband, a&nbsp;loving father, and in every
relation of life a most amiable man: he has not, however, been exposed
to any plots or conspiracies, nor been persecuted by envy and malice, as
his master anticipated; but, on the contrary, his talents and his
amiable character have procured for him public reputation and private
esteem.</p>

<p>“I sent you last night the History of British Birds, which I beg your

through life. Look at them (as&nbsp;long as they last) on every new
year’s day, and at the same time resolve, with the help of the all-wise
but unknowable God, to conduct yourself on every occasion as becomes a
good man.&mdash;Be a good son, a&nbsp;good brother, (and when the time
comes) a&nbsp;good husband, a&nbsp;good father, and a good member of
society. Peace of mind will then follow you like a shadow; and when your
mind grows rich in integrity, you will fear the frowns of no man, and
only smile at the plots and conspiracies which it is probable will be
laid against you by envy, hatred, and malice.</p>

<p>In September, 1817, Mr. Harvey came to London; and shortly
afterwards, with a view of obtaining a correct knowledge of the
principles of drawing, he became a pupil of Mr. B.&nbsp;R. Haydon, and
he certainly could not have had a better master. While improving himself
under Mr. Haydon, he drew and engraved from a picture by that eminent
artist his large cut of the Death of Dentatus, which was published in
1821.<a class = "tag" name = "tagVII87" id = "tagVII87" href =

As a large subject, this is unquestionably one of the most elaborately
engraved wood-cuts that has ever appeared. It scarcely, however, can be
considered a successful specimen of the art; for though the execution in
many parts be superior to anything of the kind, either of earlier or
more recent times, the cut, as a whole, is rather an attempt to rival
copper-plate engraving than a perfect specimen of engraving on wood,
displaying the peculiar advantages and excellences of the art within its
own legitimate bounds. More has been attempted than can be efficiently
represented by means of wood engraving. The figure of Dentatus is indeed
one of the finest specimens of the art that has ever been executed, and
the other figures in the fore-ground display no less talent; but the
rocks are of too uniform a <i>tone</i>, and some of the more distant
figures appear to <i>stick</i> to each other. These defects, however,
result from the very nature of the art, not from inability in the
engraver; for all that wood engraving admits of he has effected. It is
unnecessary to say more of this cut here: some observations relating to
the details, illustrated with specimens of the best engraved parts, will
be found in the next chapter.</p>

<p>About 1824 Mr. Harvey entirely gave up the practice of engraving, and
has since exclusively devoted himself to designing for copper-plate and
wood engravers. His designs engraved on copper are, however, few when
compared with the immense number engraved on wood. The copper-plate
engravings consist principally of the illustrations in a collected
edition of Miss Edgeworth’s Works, 1832; in Southey’s edition of
Cowper’s Works, first published in 1836, and since by Mr. Bohn in his
Standard Library; and in the small edition of Dr. Lingard’s History of
England.</p>

<p>The two cuts on pages 533 and 534 are also from drawings by Mr.
Harvey; and both are printed from casts. The first is one of the
illustrations of the Children in the Wood, published by Jennings and
Chaplin, 1831; and the subject is the uncle bargaining with the two
ruffians for the murder of the children. This cut is freely and
effectively executed, without any display of useless labour.</p>

gentleman of good degree, the gallant young knight in disguise, the
merchant of London, and her master’s son. This cut, though well
engraved, is scarcely equal to the preceding. It is, however, necessary
to observe that these cuts are not given as specimens of the engravers’
talents, but merely as two subjects designed by Mr. Harvey.</p>

<p>What has been called the “London School” of wood engraving produced
nothing that would bear a comparison with the works of Bewick and his
pupils until the late Robert Branston began to engrave on wood. About
1796, the best of the London engravers was J.&nbsp;Lee. He engraved the
cuts for the “Cheap Repository,” a&nbsp;collection of religious and
moral tracts, printed between 1794 and 1798, and sold by
J.&nbsp;Marshall, London, and S.&nbsp;Hazard, Bath. Those cuts, though
coarsely executed, as might be expected, considering the work for which
they were intended, frequently display considerable merit in the design;
and
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page535" id = "page535">
535</a></span>
in this respect several of them are scarcely inferior to the cuts drawn
and engraved by John Bewick in Dr. Trusler’s Progress of Man and
Society. Mr. Lee died in March, 1804; and on his decease, his
apprentice, Henry White, went to Newcastle, and served out the remainder
of his time with Thomas Bewick. James Lee, a&nbsp;son of Mr.
J.&nbsp;Lee, the elder, is also a wood engraver; he executed the
portraits in Hansard’s Typographia, 1825.</p>

<i>Rob. Branston.</i></p>

<p>Robert Branston, like Bewick, acquired his knowledge of wood
engraving without the instructions of a master. He was born at Lynn, in
Norfolk, in 1778, and died in London in 1827. He served his
apprenticeship to his father, a&nbsp;general copper-plate engraver and
heraldic painter, who seems to have carried on the same kind of
miscellaneous business as Mr. Beilby, the master of Bewick. About 1802
Mr. Branston came to London, and finding that wood engraving was
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page536" id = "page536">
536</a></span>
much encouraged, he determined to apply himself to that art. Some of his
first productions were cuts for lottery bills; but as he improved in the
practice of engraving on wood, he began to engrave cuts for the
illustration of books. His style of engraving is peculiarly his own, and
perfectly distinct from that of Bewick. He engraved human figures and
in-door scenes with great clearness and precision; while Bewick’s chief
excellence consisted in the natural representation of quadrupeds, birds,
landscapes, and <i>road-side</i> incidents. In the representation of
trees and of natural scenery, Branston has almost uniformly failed. Some
of the best of his earlier productions are to be found in the History of
England, published by Scholey, 1804-1810; in Bloomfield’s Wild Flowers,
1806; and in a quarto volume entitled “Epistles in Verse,” and other
poems by George Marshall, 1812.</p>

<p>The best specimen of Mr. Branston’s talents as a wood engraver is a
large cut of the Cave of Despair, in Savage’s Hints on Decorative
Printing. It was executed in rivalry with Nesbit, who engraved the cut
of Rinaldo and Armida for the same work, and it would be difficult to
decide which is the best. Both are good specimens of the styles of their
respective schools; and the subjects are well adapted to display the
peculiar excellence of the engravers. Had they exchanged subjects,
neither of the cuts would have been so well executed; but in this case
there call be little doubt that Nesbit would have engraved the figure
and the rocks in the Cave of Despair better than Branston would have
engraved the trees and the foliage in the cut of Rinaldo and Armida. The
cut on the previous page is a reduced copy of a portion of that of Mr.
Branston.</p>

<p>Mr. Branston, like many others, did not think highly of the cuts in
Bewick’s Fables; and feeling persuaded that he could produce something
better, he employed Mr. Thurston to make several designs, with the
intention of publishing a similar work. After a few of them had been
engraved, he gave up the thought of proceeding further with the work,
from a doubt of its success. Bewick’s work was already in the market;
and it was questionable if another of the same kind, appearing shortly
after, would meet with a sale adequate to defray the expense. The three
cuts in the opposite page were engraved by Mr. Branston for the proposed
work. The two first are respectively illustrations of the fables of
Industry and Sloth, and of the Two Crabs; the third was intended as a
tail-piece. The cut of Industry and Sloth is certainly superior to that
of the same subject in Bewick’s Fables; but that of the Two Crabs,
though more delicately engraved, is not equal to the cut of the same
subject in Bewick.</p>

<p>Mr. Branston also thought that Bewick’s Birds were estimated too
highly; and he engraved two or three cuts to show that he could do the
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page538" id = "page538">
538</a></span>
same things as well, or better. In this respect, however, he certainly
formed a wrong estimate of his abilities; for, it is extremely doubtful
if&mdash;even with the aid of the best designer he could find&mdash;he
could have executed twenty cuts of birds which, for natural character,
would bear a comparison with twenty of the worst engraved by Bewick
himself. The great North-country man was an artist as well as a wood
engraver; and in this respect his principal pupils have also been
distinguished. The cut on our present page is one of those engraved by
Mr. Branston to show his superiority over Bewick. The bird represented
is probably the Grey Phalarope, or Scallop-toed Sand-piper, and it is
unquestionably executed with considerable ability; but though Bewick’s
cut of the same bird be one of his worst, it is superior to that
engraved by Mr. Branston in every essential point.</p>

<p>Between twenty and thirty years ago, a wood engraver named Austin
executed several cuts, but did nothing to promote the art. William
Hughes, a&nbsp;native of Liverpool, who died in February 1825, at the
early age of thirty-two, produced a number of wood engravings of very
considerable merit. He chiefly excelled in architectural subjects. One
of his best productions is a dedication cut in the first volume of
Johnson’s Typographia, 1824, showing the interior of a chapel,
surrounded by the arms of the members of the Roxburgh Club. Another
artist of the same period, named Hugh Hughes, of whom scarcely anything
is now known, executed a whole volume of singularly beautiful wood
engravings, entitled “The Beauties of Cambria, consisting of Sixty Views
in North and South Wales,” London, 1823. The work was published by
subscription at one guinea, or on India paper at two guineas, and was
beautifully printed by the same John Johnson who printed William Hughes’
cuts in the “Typographia,” and who, a&nbsp;few years previously, had
conducted the Lee Priory Press. The annexed four examples will give an
idea of the high finish and perfection of this elegant series.</p>

<p>One of the principal wood engravers in Germany, about the time that
Bewick began to practise the art in England, was Unger. In 1779 he
published a tract, containing five cuts of his own engraving, discussing
the question whether Albert Durer actually engraved on wood: his
decision is in the negative. In the same year, his son also published a
dissertation, illustrated with wood-cuts, on the progress of wood
engraving in Brandenburg, with an account of the principal books
containing wood-cuts printed in that part of Prussia. They jointly
executed some chiaro-scuros, and a number of trifling book-illustrations
such as are to be found in Heineken’s Idée Générale d’une Collection
complette d’Estampes. These cuts are of a very inferior character.
Gubitz, a&nbsp;German wood engraver, who flourished about thirty years
ago, executed several cuts which are much superior to any I have seen by
the Ungers. Several of those engraved by Gubitz, bear considerable
resemblance to the cuts of Bewick. The principal French wood engravers
in the eighteenth century, subsequent to Papillon, were Gritner and
Beugnet; but neither of them produced anything superior to the worst of
the cuts to be found in the work of Papillon. With them wood engraving
in France rather declined than advanced. Of late years the art has made
great progress both in Germany and France; and should the taste for
wood-cuts continue to increase in those countries, their engravers may
regain for the art that popularity which it enjoyed in former times,
when Nuremberg and Lyons were the great marts for works illustrated with
wood engravings.</p>

Small wood-cuts appear to have been frequently used about this time in
newspapers, for what the Americans call a “caption” to advertisements.
“The great art in writing advertisements is the finding out a proper
method to catch the reader’s eye, without which many a good thing may
pass over unobserved, or be lost among commissions of bankrupts.
Asterisks and hands were formerly of great use for this purpose. Of late
years the N.B.&nbsp;has been much in fashion, as also <i>little cuts and
figures</i>, the invention of which we must ascribe to the author of
spring trusses.”&mdash;Tatler, No.&nbsp;224, 14th September 1710. The
practice is not yet obsolete. Cuts of this kind are still to be found in
country newspapers prefixed to advertisements of quack medicines,

Some of the cuts in an edition of Dryden’s plays, 6&nbsp;vols. 12mo.
published by Tonson and Watts in 1717, have evidently been either
engraved on some kind of soft metal or been casts from a wood block. In
the corner of such cuts, the marks of the pins, which have fastened the
engraved metal-plate to a piece of wood below, are quite apparent.</p>

“The Fables of Mr. John Gay,” with cuts by Thomas and John Bewick, was
published in 1779. “Select Fables, a&nbsp;new edition improved,” with
cuts by the same, appeared in 1784; both in duodecimo, printed by
T.&nbsp;Saint, Newcastle-on-Tyne. The cuts in the latter work are
considerably better than those in the former. Several of the cuts which
originally appeared in those two works are to be found in “Select
Fables; with cuts designed and engraved by Thomas and John Bewick, and
others,” octavo, printed for Emerson Charnely, Newcastle-on-Tyne,
1820.</p>

The cuts in two different editions of Æsop’s Fables, published at
Paris,&mdash;the one by Charles Le Clerc in 1731, and the other by

Vincent Le Sueur appears on the frontispiece to Le Clerc’s edition.</p>

There can be no doubt that the mention of Kirkall’s name is purposely
avoided. The “attempts” of Count Caylus, who executed several
chiaro-scuros by means of copper-plates and wood-blocks subsequent to
Kirkall, are noticed; but the name of Nicholas Le Sueur, who assisted
the Count and engraved the wood-blocks, is never mentioned. It is also
stated in the Essay, page 6, that some of the subjects begun by Count
Caylus were finished by Mr. Jackson, and “approved by the lovers and
promoters of that art in Paris.”</p>

Papillon, in the Supplement to his “Traité de la Gravure en Bois,” page

Traité de la Gravure en Bois, Supplement, tom. iii. p.&nbsp;39. In the
first volume, page 335, he alludes to the disorder as “un accident et
une fatalité commune à plusieurs graveurs, aussi bien que moi.” Has the
practice of engraving on wood or on copper a tendency to induce
insanity? Three distinguished engravers, all from the same town, have in
recent times lost their reason; and several others, from various parts
of the country, have been afflicted with the same distressing malady.
These facts deserve the consideration of parents who design to send
their sons as pupils to engravers. When there is the least reason to
suspect a hereditary taint of insanity in the constitution of the youth,
it perhaps would be safest to put him to some other business or
profession where close attention to minute objects is less required.</p>

This poem was privately printed and never published. It was written
expressly in imitation of Dr. Darwin, some of whose friends had
contended that his style was inimitable, but were deceived into a belief
that this poem was written by him, until the real author avowed himself.
In the Advertisement prefixed to it Dr. Beddoes speaks thus of the
engraver of the cuts: “The engravings in the following pages will be
praised or excused when it is known that they are the performance of an
uneducated and uninstructed artist, if such an application be not a
profanation of the term, in a remote village. All the assistance he
received was from the example of Mr. Bewick’s most masterly engravings
on wood.” The name of this self-taught artist was Edward Dyas, who was
parish-clerk at Madeley, Shropshire, where the book was printed. The
<i>compositor</i>, as is stated in the same Advertisement, was a young
woman.&mdash;See <i>Bibliotheca Parriana</i>, p.&nbsp;513.</p>

Several cuts in which cross-hatching is introduced occur in the “Traité
de la Gravure en Bois;” and the author refers to several others in the
“Recueil des Papillons” as displaying the same kind of work. He
considers the execution of such hatchings as the test of excellence in
wood engraving; “for,” he observes, “when a person has learnt to execute
them he may boast of having mastered one of the most difficult parts of
the art, and may justly assume the name of a wood engraver.”&mdash;Tom.

He complains in another part of the work that many printers, both
compositors and pressmen, by pretending to engrave on wood, had brought
the art into disrepute. They not only spoiled the work of regular
engravers, but <i>dared</i> to engrave wood-cuts themselves.</p>

The portrait was engraved “<i>in venerationis testimonium</i>,” and

<p>Papillon speaks favourably of Caron as a wood engraver; he says that
“he is much superior to Nioul, Jackson, Contat, Lefevre, and others his
contemporaries, and would at least have equalled the Le Sueurs had he
applied himself to drawing the figure.”</p>

In the chiaro-scuros from original drawings in the collection of
Monsieur Crozat, with the figures etched by Count Caylus, the
wood-blocks from which the sepia-coloured tints were printed were
engraved by Nicholas Le Sueur.&mdash;About the same period Arthur Pond
and George Knapton in England, and Count M.&nbsp;A. Zanetti in Italy,
executed in the same manner several chiaro-scuros in imitation of
drawings and sketches by eminent painters. The taste for chiaro-scuros
seems to have been revived in France by the Regent-Duke of Orleans, who
declared that Ugo da Carpi’s chiaro-scuros afforded him more pleasure
than any other kind of prints.</p>

“<i>during his apprenticeship</i>.” This must be a mistake; as his
apprenticeship expired in October 1774, and he obtained the premium in
1775. It is possible, however, that the engraving may have been executed
during that period.</p>

Mr. Atkinson talks about wood engraving having taken a nap for a century

restorer of the “long-lost art;” and yet, with singular inconsistency,
in another part of his Sketch, he refers to Papillon, whose work,
containing a minute account of the art as then practised, was published
about two years before Bewick began to engrave on wood.&mdash;The

the “long-lost art,” in his Memoir of Thomas Bewick.</p>

“Some Account of the Life, Genius, and Personal Habits of the late
Thomas Bewick, the celebrated Artist and Engraver on Wood. By his Friend
John F.&nbsp;M. Dovaston, Esq. A.M.,” was published in Loudon’s Magazine
of Natural History, 1829-1830. Mr. Dovaston seems to have caught a
knowledge of Bewick’s personal habits at a glance; and a considerable
number of his observations on other matters appear to have been the
result of a peculiar quickness of apprehension. What he says about the
church of Ovingham not being “parted into proud pews,” when Bewick was a
boy, is incorrect. It had, in fact, been pewed from an early period;
for, on the 2nd of September, 1763, Dr. Sharp, Archdeacon of
Northumberland, on visiting the church, notices the pews as being “very
bad and irregular;” and on a board over the vestry-door is the following
inscription: “This Church was new pewed, A.&nbsp;D. 1766.” No boards
from this church containing specimens of Bewick’s early drawing were
ever in the possession of the Duke of Northumberland. Mr. Dovaston is
frequently imaginative, but seldom correct. His personal sketch of
Bewick is a ridiculous caricature.</p>

Pinkerton having stated in his Scottish Gallery, on the authority of
Messrs. Morison, printers, of Perth, that Bewick, “observing the
uncommon genius of his late apprentice, Robert Johnson, employed him to
trace the figures on the wood in the History of Quadrupeds,” Bewick, in
his letter, printed in the Monthly Magazine for November 1805,
previously quoted, thus denies the assertion: “It is only necessary for
me to declare, and this will be attested by my partner Mr. Beilby, who
compiled the History of Quadrupeds, and was a proprietor of the work,
that neither Robert Johnson, nor any person but myself, made the
drawings, or traced or cut them on the wood.”&mdash;Robert Johnson was
employed by Messrs. Morison to copy for the Scottish Gallery several
portraits at Taymouth Castle, the seat of the Earl of Breadalbane.
Bewick in this letter carefully avoids pleading to that with which he
was not charged; he does not deny that several of the drawings of the
tail-pieces in the History of British Birds were made by Robert Johnson.
A&nbsp;pupil of Bewick’s, now living, saw many of Johnson’s drawings for
these cuts, and sat beside Clennell when he was engraving them.</p>

These three cuts were engraved by one of Bewick’s pupils, named Henry
Hole. Neither Bewick’s memory nor his daughter’s had been accurate on
this occasion; but not one of the other cuts which they failed to
recollect can be compared with those engraved by Bewick himself. In
addition to those three, the following, not engraved by Bewick himself,
had appeared at the time the above conversation took place&mdash;some
time between 1825 and 1826:&mdash;the Brent Goose, the Lesser Imber, and
the Cormorant, engraved by L.&nbsp;Clennell; the Velvet Duck, the
Red-breasted Merganser, and the Crested Cormorant, by H.&nbsp;Hole; the

“He never could, he said, please himself in his representations of water
in a state of motion, and a horse galloping: his taste must have been
fastidious indeed, if that beautiful moonlight scene at sea, page 120,
vol. ii. [edition 1816]; the river scene at page 126; the sea breaking
among the rocks at page 168, or 177, or 200, or 216; or the rippling of
the water as it leaves the feet of the old fisherman, at page 95, did
not satisfy him.” In scarcely one of the cuts engraved by Bewick himself
is water in a state of motion well represented. He knew his own
deficiency in this respect; though Mr. Atkinson, not being able to

The subject of this cut is thus explained in Brockett’s Glossary of
North Country Words: “<span class = "smallcaps">Neddy, Netty</span>, a
certain place that will not bear a written explanation; but which is
<i>depicted to the very life</i> in a tail-piece in the first edition of
Bewick’s Land Birds, p.&nbsp;285. In the second edition a bar is placed
against the offending part of this broad display of native humour.”</p>

“Mr. Atkinson must have misunderstood Bewick, as the old man’s name was
George, not Matthew, Carr. He was grandfather to Edward Willis, one of
Bewick’s pupils, and to George Stephenson, the celebrated engineer.
Matthew Carr was a tailor, who lived and died at Righton, in
Durham.”&mdash;<span class = "smallcaps">Jno. Jackson.</span></p>

The cuts engraved by Bewick himself are: a tail-piece (a&nbsp;Cow
standing under some bushes) to “The Two Frogs,” page 200. The fable of
“The Deer and the Lion,” page 315. “Waiting for Death,” page 338. He
also engraved the figure of the <i>Lion</i> in the fable of “The Lion
and the four Bulls,” page 89 (see cut at our page 480). The Man, Crow,
and Sheep in the fable of the “Eagle and the Crow,” of which we give the
original cut. The Man and two Birds in the fable of “The Husbandman and
the Stork.”</p>

Mr. Atkinson says that this account determined Bewick to write a life of
himself. It appears that he actually completed such a work, but that his
family at present decline to publish it. [Mr. Jackson adds,
“I&nbsp;engraved two portraits for it: one was a portrait of the Rev.
Wm. Turner, of Newcastle, the other that of an engineer or millwright,
at Morpeth, named Rastack, or Raistick<ins class = "correction" title =

“There is a tradition that the two black marks on the opposite sides of
the haddock were occasioned by St. Peter’s thumb and fore-finger when he
took the piece of money out of the fish’s mouth to give it as a tribute
to Cæsar.”</p>

Bewick’s suspicions in this respect were not altogether groundless.
Happening to go into a bookbinder’s shop in Newcastle in 1818, he found
a copy of his Fables, which had been sent there to bind before the work
had been issued to the public. He claimed the book as his property, and
carried it away; but the name of the owner who had purchased it, knowing
it to have been dishonestly obtained, was not publicly divulged.</p>

About 1799 Bewick frequently corresponded with Mr. Abraham Newland,
cashier of the Bank of England, respecting a plan which he had devised
to prevent the forgery of bank notes. He was offered a situation in the
Bank to superintend the engraving and printing of the notes, but he
refused to leave Newcastle. The notes of Ridley and Co.’s bank were for
many years engraved and printed under the superintendence of Bewick,
who, after <ins class = "correction" title = ". missing">Mr.</ins>
Beilby’s retirement, still continued the business of copper-plate
engraving and printing, and for this purpose always kept presses of his
own.</p>

The last <i>bird</i> that Bewick engraved was the Cream-coloured Plover,
at page 383, vol. i.&nbsp;of the Birds, in the edition of 1832. Several
years previous to his death he had projected a History of British
Fishes, but very little progress was made in the work. A&nbsp;few cuts
of fishes were engraved, chiefly by his pupils; that of the John Dory,
an impression of which is said to have been sold for a considerable sum,
is one of those not engraved by Bewick himself. As a work of art the
value of an India paper impression of the John Dory may be about
twopence. This cut is an early performance of Mr. Jackson’s, who also
engraved, in 1823, about twenty of the additional tail-pieces in the
last edition of the Birds, 1832.</p>

This cut is eleven inches and five-eighths wide by eight inches and
three-fourths high. It is entitled, “Waiting for Death: Bewick’s last
work, left unfinished, and intended to have been completed by a series
of impressions from separate blocks printed over each other.”</p>

When Bewick removed the printing of his works from Mr. Hodgson’s office
to that of Mr. E.&nbsp;Walker, a&nbsp;pressman, named Barlow, was
brought from London for the purpose of printing the cuts in the second
volume of the Birds in a proper manner. Bewick’s favourite pressman at
Mr. Hodgson’s was John Simpson.</p>

The following is a list of the principal engraved portraits of Bewick:
on copper, by J.&nbsp;A. Kidd, from a painting by Miss Kirkley, 1798. On
copper, by Thomas Ranson, after a painting by William Nicholson, 1816.
On copper, by I.&nbsp;Summerfield, from a miniature by Murphy&mdash;that
alluded to in Bewick’s letter to Mr. C.&nbsp;Gregson, previously
quoted&mdash;1816. On copper, by John Burnet, from a painting by James
Ramsey, 1817. Copies of all those portraits, engraved on wood, are given
in Charnley’s edition of Select Fables, 1820; and there is also prefixed
to the work a portrait excellently engraved on wood by Charlton Nesbit,
one of Bewick’s earliest pupils, from a drawing made on the block by
William Nicholson.&mdash;In the Memoir of Thomas Bewick, prefixed to the
Natural History of Parrots, Naturalist’s Library, vol. vi., it is
incorrectly stated that Ranson, the engraver of one of the above
portraits, was a pupil of Bewick’s. He was a pupil of J.&nbsp;A. Kidd,
copper-plate engraver, Newcastle.</p>

This line is adapted from Wordsworth, who, at the commencement of his
verses entitled “The Two Thieves, or The Last Stage of Avarice,” thus
expresses his high opinion of the talents of Bewick:</p>

<p><a name = "noteVII73" id = "noteVII73" href = "#tagVII73">VII.73</a>
Johnson’s water-colour drawings for most of the cuts in Bewick’s Fables,
are extremely beautiful. They are the size of the cuts; and as a set are
perhaps the finest small drawings of the kind that were ever made. Their
finish and accuracy of drawing are admirable&mdash;they look like
miniature <i>Paul Potters</i>. It is known to only a few persons that
they were drawn by Johnson during his apprenticeship. Most of them were
copied on the block by William Harvey, and the rest chiefly by Bewick
himself.</p>

John Johnson, a cousin of Robert, was also an apprentice of Beilby and
Bewick. He was a wood engraver, and executed a few of the tail-pieces in
the History of British Birds. Like Robert, he possessed a taste for
drawing; and the cut of the Hermit at his morning devotion, engraved by
T.&nbsp;Bewick, in Poems by Goldsmith and Parnell, was designed by him.
He died at Newcastle about 1797, shortly after the expiration of his
apprenticeship.</p>

Mr. Thurston was a native of Scarborough, and originally a copper-plate
engraver. He engraved, under the late Mr. James Heath, parts of the two
celebrated plates of the death of Major Peirson and the Dead Soldier. He
was one of the best designers on wood of his time. He drew very
beautifully, but his designs are too frequently deficient in natural
character and feeling. He died in 1821.</p>

The practice of thus giving a fictitious value to works of limited
circulation, and which are not likely to reach a second edition during
the lifetime of their authors, is less frequent now than it was a few
years ago. It is little more than a trick to enhance the price of the
book to subscribers, by giving them an assurance that no second edition
can appear with the same embellishments. In three cases out of four
where the plates and cuts of a work have been intentionally destroyed,
there was little prospect of such work reaching a second edition during
the writer’s life.</p>

Between the expiration of his apprenticeship and his departure for
London he appears to have engraved several excellent cuts for a
school-book entitled “The Hive of Ancient and Modern Literature,”
printed by S.&nbsp;Hodgson, Newcastle.&mdash;Clennell’s fellow-pupils
were Henry Hole and Edward Willis. Mr. Hole engraved the cuts in
M’Creery’s Press, 1803, and in Poems by Felicia Dorothea Browne,
(afterwards Mrs. Hemans) 1808. Mr. Hole gave up wood engraving several
years ago on succeeding to a large estate in Derbyshire. Mr. Willis, who
was a cousin of Mr. George Stephenson, the celebrated engineer, died in
London, the 10th of February, 1842, aged 58; but had for some time
previously entirely abandoned the art.</p>

<p><a name = "noteVII79" id = "noteVII79" href = "#tagVII79">VII.79</a>
He also invariably corrected the <i>outline</i> of Thurston’s animals;
“Fainting for the Living Waters” in the Religious Emblems, and a little
subject in an edition of Beattie’s Minstrel, published at Alnwick,
representing a shepherd and dog on the brow of a hill, were thus
improved by Clennell.</p>

Isaac Nicholson, now established as a wood engraver at Newcastle, was
the apprentice immediately preceding Harvey. W.&nbsp;W. Temple, who
abandoned the business on the expiration of his apprenticeship for that
of a draper and silk-mercer, came to Bewick shortly after Harvey; and
the younger apprentice was John Armstrong.</p>

What may be considered the sketches for the principal cuts were supplied
by Northcote himself. The following account of the manner in which he
<i>composed</i> them is extracted from a Sketch of his Life, prefixed to
the second series of his Fables, 1833:&mdash;“It was by a curious
process that Mr. Northcote really made the designs for these Fables the
amusement of his old age, for his talent as a draftsman, excelling as he
did in animals, was rarely required by this undertaking. His general
practice was to collect great numbers of prints of animals, and to cut
them out; he then moved such as he selected about upon the surface of a
piece of paper until he had illustrated the fable by placing them to his
satisfaction, and had thus composed his subject; then fixing the
different figures with paste to the paper, a&nbsp;few pen or pencil
touches rendered this singular composition complete enough to place in
the hands of Mr. Harvey, by whom it was adapted or freely translated on
the blocks for the engravers.”&mdash;Mr. Harvey’s work was something
more than free translation. He <i>completed</i> that which Northcote
merely suggested. The tail-pieces and letters are all of Mr. Harvey’s
own invention and drawing.</p>

Charles Thompson, the brother of John, is also a wood engraver. He
resides at Paris, and his cuts are better known in France than in this
country. Miss Eliza Thompson, a&nbsp;daughter of John Thompson, also
engraves on wood.</p>

Bewick was accustomed to speak highly of the cuts of fish in this
beautiful work (several of which are given on the previous pages): the
Salmon, engraved by J.&nbsp;Thompson, and the Eel, by H.&nbsp;White, he
especially admired. Among others scarcely less excellent are the Pike,
by R.&nbsp;Branston; and the Carp, the Grayling, and the Ruffe, by
H.&nbsp;White. Major, in his second edition, went to great expense in
substituting other engravings for most of these, with the intention of
surpassing all that, by the aid of artists, he had done before&mdash;in
which he to some extent succeeded. In this second edition, the Salmon is
engraved by John Jackson. All Mr. Major’s wood-cuts, as well as many of
Bewick’s, having passed into the hands of Henry G.&nbsp;Bohn (the
present publisher), his edition of Walton’s Angler is extensively
enriched by them.</p>
