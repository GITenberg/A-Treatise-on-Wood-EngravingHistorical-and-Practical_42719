best of the wood-cuts of the time of Albert Durer, more especially those
executed by German engravers, are for the most part of rather large
size; the best of those, however, which appeared within forty years of
his decease are generally small. The art of wood engraving, both as
regards design and execution, appears to have attained its highest
perfection within about ten years of the time of Durer’s decease; for
the cuts which, in my opinion, display the greatest excellence of the
art as practised in former times, were published in 1538. The cuts to
which I allude are those of the celebrated Dance of Death, which were
first published in that year at Lyons. So admirably are those cuts
executed,&mdash;with so much feeling and with so perfect a knowledge of
the capabilities of the art,&mdash;that I do not think any wood engraver
of the present time is capable of surpassing them. The manner in which
they are engraved is comparatively simple: there is no laboured and
unnecessary cross-hatching where the same effect might be obtained by
simpler means; no display
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page325" id = "page325">
325</a></span>
of fine work merely to show the artist’s talent in cutting delicate
lines. Every line is expressive; and the end is always obtained by the
simplest means. In this the talent and feeling of the engraver are
chiefly displayed. He wastes not his time in mere mechanical
execution&mdash;which in the present day is often mistaken for
excellence;&mdash;he endeavours to give to each character its
appropriate expression; and in this he appears to have succeeded better,
considering the small size of the cuts, than any other wood engraver,
either of times past or present.</p>

<p>Though two or three of the cuts which will subsequently be given may
be of rather earlier date than those of the Dance of Death, it seems
preferable to give first some account of this celebrated work; and to
introduce the cuts alluded to, though not in strict chronological
order,&mdash;which is the less necessary as they do not illustrate the
progress of the art,&mdash;with others executed in a similar style.</p>

<p>Long before the publication of the work now so generally known as
“The Dance of Death,” a&nbsp;series of paintings representing, in a
similar manner, Death seizing on persons of all ranks and ages, had
appeared on the walls of several churches. A&nbsp;Dance of Death was
painted in the cloisters of the Church of the Innocents at Paris, in the
cloisters of St. Paul’s, London, and in the portico of St. Mary’s,
Lubec. The painting in St Paul’s is said to have been executed at the
cost of one Jenkin Carpenter, who lived in the reign of Henry VI, and
who was one of the executors of that famous “lord-mayor of London,”
Richard Whittington; and Dugdale, in his History of St. Paul’s
Cathedral, says that it was in imitation of that in the cloisters of the
Church of the Innocents at Paris.<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI1" id =
"tagVI1" href = "#noteVI1">VI.1</a> This subject seems to have been
usually known in former times by the name of “The Dance of Machabre,”
from a French or German poet&mdash;for this point is not settled by the
learned&mdash;of the name of Macaber or Macabre, who is said to have
written a poem on this subject.<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI2" id =

Dance of Death, however, which as a painting has attained greater
celebrity and given rise to much more discussion than any other, is that
which was painted on the wall of a kind of court-house attached to the
Church of the Dominicans at Basle. This painting has frequently been
ascribed to Holbein; but it certainly was executed before he was born;
and there is not the slightest reason to believe that he ever touched it
in any of the repairs which it underwent in subsequent years.</p>

<p>The following particulars respecting this painting are such as seem
best authenticated.</p>

<p>It is said to owe its origin to a plague which ravaged the city of
Basle in 1439, during the time of the great council, which commenced in
1431, and did not terminate till 1448. A&nbsp;number of persons of
almost all ranks, whom the council had brought to this city, having
fallen victims to the plague, it is said that the painting was executed
in remembrance of the event, and as a memento of the uncertainty of
life. Though it may be true that the great mortality at Basle in 1439
might have been the occasion of such a picture in the
church-court&mdash;<i>Kirchhofe</i>, as it is called by Hegner in his
Life of Holbein&mdash;of the Dominicans in that city, it is almost
certain that the subject must have been suggested by one of much earlier
date painted on the walls of an old building which had formerly been the
cloisters of a nunnery which stood in that part of Basle which is called
the Little City. This convent was founded in 1275; and the painting
appears to have been executed in 1312, according to the following date,
which was to be seen above one of the figures, that of the Count, who
was also one of the characters in the painting in the church-court of
the Dominicans: “<span class = "blackletter">Dussent jar treihuntert und
Xii</span>;” in English: One thousand three hundred and twelve. Several
of the figures in this old painting were almost the same as in that of
the church-court of the Dominicans, though executed in a coarser manner;
and, like the latter, were accompanied with explanatory inscriptions in
verse. This curious old work appears to have remained unnoticed till
1766, when one Emanuel Büchel, of Basle, by trade a baker, but an
admirer of art, and an industrious draughtsman, had his attention
directed to it. He made a careful copy in colours of all that then
remained of it, and his drawings are now in the public library of Basle.
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page327" id = "page327">
327</a></span>
“This oldest Dance of Death,” says Hegner, writing in 1827, “is almost
entirely effaced, and becomes daily more so, as well on account of age
as from the cloisters of the old nunnery having been for many years used
as a warehouse for salt.”<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI3" id = "tagVI3"
href = "#noteVI3">VI.3</a></p>

<p>It is supposed that the Dance of Death in the church-court of the
Dominicans at Basle was originally painted in <i>fresco</i> or
distemper. The number of characters, each accompanied by a figure of
Death, was originally forty;<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI4" id =
"tagVI4" href = "#noteVI4">VI.4</a> but in 1568, a&nbsp;painter, named
Hans Hugo Klauber, who was employed by the magistrates to repair the old
painting, introduced a figure of the reformer Oecolampadius as if
preaching to the characters composing the Dance, with portraits of
himself, his wife, and their little son, at the end. It is probable that
he painted over the old figures in oil-colour, and introduced sundry
alterations, suggested by other paintings and engravings of the same
subject. It appears likely that, at the same time, many of the old
inscriptions were changed for others more in accordance with the
doctrines of the Reformation, which then prevailed at Basle. The verses
above the figure of the Pope were certainly not such as would have been
tolerated at the period when the subject is supposed to have been first
painted.<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI5" id = "tagVI5" href =
"#noteVI5">VI.5</a> In 1616 the painting was again repaired; but, though
a Latin inscription was then added containing the names of the
magistrates who had thus taken care to preserve it, there is no mention
made of any artist by whom the subject
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page328" id = "page328">
328</a></span>
had been originally painted or subsequently retouched. Had there been
any record of Holbein having been at any time employed on the work, such
a circumstance would most likely have been noticed; as his memory was
then held in the highest estimation, and Basle prided herself on having
had so eminent an artist enrolled among the number of her citizens. In
1658 the painting was again renewed: and there seems reason to believe
that further alterations were then introduced both in the costume and
the colouring. It was retouched in 1703; but from that time, as the
paint began to peel off from the decaying walls, all attempts for its
further preservation appear to have been considered hopeless. It would
indeed seem to have become in a great measure disregarded by the
magistrates, for a rope-maker used to exercise his trade under the roof
that protected it from the weather. As the old wall stood much in the
way of new buildings, it is not unlikely that they might be rather
wishful to have it removed. In 1805 the magistrates pronounced sentence
against the Dance of Death, and the wall on which it was painted was by
their orders pulled down, though not without considerable opposition on
the part of many of the citizens, more especially those of the suburb of
St. John, within which the old church-court of the Dominicans stood.
Several pieces of the painting were collected, and are still preserved
at Basle as memorials of the old “Todten-tanz,” which was formerly an
object of curiosity with all strangers who visited the city, and which
has been so frequently the subject of discussion in the history of
art.</p>

<p>Mr. Douce has given a list of many books containing the figures of a
Dance of Death printed before the celebrated Simulachres et Historiées
Faces de la Mort of Lyons, 1538; and among the principal the following
may be here enumerated.&mdash;A German edition, intitled “Der Dodtendanz
mit figuren. Clage und Antwort schon von allen staten der Welt.” This
work, which is small folio, is mentioned in Braun’s Notitia librorum in
Bibliotheca ad SS. Udalricum et Afram Augustæ, vol. ii. p.&nbsp;62. It
is without date, but Braun supposes that it may have been printed
between 1480 and 1500. It consists of twenty-two leaves, with wood-cuts
of the Pope, Cardinal, Bishop, Abbot, &amp;c. &amp;c.&nbsp;accompanied
by figures of Death. The descriptions are in German verse, and printed
in double columns.&mdash;The earliest printed book on this subject with
a date is intitled “La Danse Macabre imprimée par ung nommé Guy
Marchand,” &amp;c.&nbsp;Paris, 1485, small folio. In 1486 Guy
Marchand,&mdash;or Guyot Marchant, as he is also called,&mdash;printed
another edition, “La Danse Macabre nouvelle,” with several additional
cuts; and in the same year he printed “La Danse Macabre des Femmes,”
a&nbsp;small folio of fifteen leaves. This is the first edition of the
Macaber Dance of females. Thirty-two subjects are described, but there
are only cuts of two, the
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page329" id = "page329">
329</a></span>
Queen and the Duchess. In 1490 an edition appeared with the following
title: “Chorea ab eximio Macabro versibus Alemanicis edita, et à Petro
Desrey emendata. Parisiis, per magistrum Guidonem Mercatorem [Guy
Marchand] pro Godefrido de Marnef.” In the same year Marchand printed
another edition of “La nouvelle Danse Macabre des Hommes;” and in the
year following there appeared from his press a second edition of “La
Danse Macabre des Femmes,” with cuts of all the characters and other
additions. A&nbsp;Dance of Death, according to Von der Hagen, in his
Deutsche Poesie, p.&nbsp;459, was printed at Leipsic in 1496; and in
1499 a “Grande Danse Macabre des Hommes et Femmes” was printed in folio
at Lyons. The latter is supposed to be the earliest that contains cuts
of both men and women. About 1500, Ant. Verard printed an edition, in
folio, of the Danse Macabre at Paris; and in various years between 1500
and 1530 a work with the same title and similar cuts was printed at
Paris, Troyes, Rouen, Lyons, and Geneva. Besides those works, characters
from the Dance of Death were frequently introduced as incidental
illustrations in books of devotion, more especially in those usually
denominated Horæ or Hours of the Virgin, and printed in France.<a class
= "tag" name = "tagVI6" id = "tagVI6" href = "#noteVI6">VI.6</a></p>

<p>The celebrated “Dance of Death,” the cuts of which have been so
generally ascribed to Hans Holbein as the engraver as well as designer,
was first published at Lyons, in 1538. It is of small quarto size, and
the title is as follows: “Les Simulachres &amp; Historiées faces de la
Mort, autant elegammēt pourtraictes, que artificiellement imaginées.
A&nbsp;Lyon, Soubz l’escu de Coloigne. <span class =
"smallroman">M.D.XXXVIII.</span>” On the title-page is an emblematic
wood-cut, very indifferently executed, representing three heads joined
together, with a wreath above them; the middle one a full face, and
those on each side in profile. Instead of shoulders, the heads, or
busts, are provided with a pair of wings of peacock’s feathers; they
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page330" id = "page330">
330</a></span>
rest on a kind of pedestal, on which is also an open book inscribed with
the maxim, “<span class = "greek smallroman" lang = "el" title =
"(Greek) GNÔTHI SEAUTON">ΓΝΩΘΙ ΣΕΑΥΤΟΝ</span>.” A large serpent is seen
confined by the middle in a hole which must be supposed to pass through
the pedestal; and to it (the pedestal) are chained two globes,&mdash;one
surmounted by a small cross, like the emblem of imperial authority, and
the other having two wings. This emblematic cut, which is certainly not
“l’escu de Coloigne,” is accompanied with the motto “<i>Usus me
Genuit</i>.”<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI7" id = "tagVI7" href =
"#noteVI7">VI.7</a> At the conclusion of the book is the imprint, within
an ornamental wood-cut border: “<span class = "smallroman">EXCVDEBANT
LVGDVNI MELCHIOR ET GASPAR TRECHSEL FRATRES. 1538.</span>” The title is
succeeded by a preface, of six pages, which is followed by seven pages
more, descriptive of “diverses tables de Mort, non painctes, mais
extraictes de l’escripture saincte, colorées par Docteurs
Ecclesiastiques, et umbragées par Philosophes.” After those verbal
sketches of Death come the cuts, one on each page; and they are
succeeded by a series of descriptions of death and reflections on
mortality, the general title to which, commencing at signature H, is,
“Figures de la Mort moralement descriptes, &amp; depeinctes selon
l’authorité de l’scripture, &amp; des sainctz Peres.”</p>

<p>By far the most important passage in the book, at least so far as
relates to the designer or engraver of the cuts, occurs in the preface,
which is written much in the style of a pedantic father-confessor to a
nunnery who felt a pleasure in ornamenting his Christian discourses and
exhortations with the flowers of Pagan eloquence. The preface is
addressed, “A&nbsp;moult reverende Abbesse du religieux convent
S.&nbsp;Pierre de Lyon, Madame Jehanne de Touszele, Salut dun vray
Zele,”<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI8" id = "tagVI8" href =
"#noteVI8">VI.8</a> and the passage above mentioned is to the following
effect. “But to return to our figured representations of Death, we have
greatly to regret the death of him who has imagined such elegant figures
as are herein contained, as much excelling all those heretofore
printed,<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI9" id = "tagVI9" href =
"#noteVI9">VI.9</a> as the pictures of Apelles or of Zeuxis surpass
those of modern times; for, his funereal histories,
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page331" id = "page331">
331</a></span>
with their gravely versified descriptions, excite such admiration in
beholders, that the figures of Death appear to them most life-like,
while those of the living are the very pictures of mortality. It
therefore seems to me that Death, fearing that this excellent painter
would paint him in a manner so lively, that he should be no longer
feared as Death, and apprehensive that the artist would thus become
immortal, determined to shorten his days, and thus prevent him finishing
other subjects which he had already drawn. Among these is one of a
waggoner, knocked down and crushed under his broken waggon, the wheels
and horses of which appear so frightfully shattered and maimed that it
is as fearful to see their overthrow as it is amusing to behold the
liquorishness of a figure of Death, who is perceived roguishly sucking
the wine out of a broken cask, by means of a reed. To such imperfect
subjects, as to the inimitable heavenly bow named Iris,<a class = "tag"
name = "tagVI10" id = "tagVI10" href = "#noteVI10">VI.10</a> no one has
ventured to put the last hand, on account of the bold drawing,
perspectives, and shadows contained in this inimitable chef-d’œuvre,
there so gracefully delineated, that from it we may derive a pleasing
sadness and a melancholy pleasure, as in a thing mournfully delightful.”
The cut of the waggoner, described by the French euphuist, was, however,
afterwards finished, and, with others, inserted in a subsequent edition
of the work. It is figured in the present volume at page 344.</p>

<p>The number of cuts in the first edition, now under examination, is
forty-one; above each is a text of Scripture, in Latin; and below are
four verses in French&mdash;the “descriptions severement rithmées,”
mentioned in the preface&mdash;containing some moral or reflection
germane to the subject. A&nbsp;few sets of impressions of all those
cuts, except one, appear to have been taken before the work appeared at
Lyons. They have been printed by means of a press,&mdash;not taken by
friction in the manner in which wood engravers usually take their
proofs,&mdash;and at the top of each cut is the name in the German
language, but in Italic type. “Why those German names,” says Hegner, “in
a work which, so far as we know, was first published at Lyons? They
appear to confirm the opinion of the cuts having been actually engraved
at Basle; and the descriptions correspond with the dialect of that
city.” The late Mr. Ottley had impressions of forty of those original
cuts, and six of those which were inserted in a later edition. In his
Inquiry into the Origin and Early History of Engraving, Mr. Ottley,
speaking of the Dance of Death, says: “It is certain that the cuts had
been previously printed at Basle; and, indeed, some writers assert that
the work was published in that city, with texts of Scripture, in the
German language, above the cuts, and verses, in the
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page332" id = "page332">
332</a></span>
same language, underneath, as early as 1530; although, hitherto,
I&nbsp;have been unable to meet with or hear of any person who had seen
a copy of such an edition.” In a note upon this passage, Jansen, the
compiler of an Essay on the Origin of Engraving, and the anonymous
author of a work entitled Notices sur les Graveurs, Besançon, 1807, are
cited as mentioning such an edition. To give every one his due, however,
and to show the original authority for the existence of such an edition,
I&nbsp;beg here to give an extract from Papillon, who never felt any
difficulty in supposing a date, and whose conjectures such writers as
Jansen have felt as little hesitation in converting into certainties.
The substance of Papillon’s observations on this point is as follows:
“But to return to Holbein’s Dance of Death, which is unquestionably a
master-piece of wood engraving. There are several editions; the first of
which, <i>so far as may be judged</i>, ought to be about 1530, as has
been already said,<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI11" id = "tagVI11" href
= "#noteVI11">VI.11</a> and was printed at Basle or Zurich, with a title
to each cut, and, <i>I&nbsp;believe</i>, verses underneath, all in the
German language.” What Papillon puts forth as a matter of conjecture and
opinion, Von Murr, Jansen, and the author of the Notices sur les
Graveurs, promulgate as facts, and Mr. Ottley refers to the two latter
writers as if he were well inclined to give credit to their
assertions.</p>

<p>From the following passage it would appear that Mr. Ottley had also
been willing to believe that those impressions might have been
accompanied with explanatory verses and texts of Scripture. “I&nbsp;have
only to add, upon the subject of this celebrated work, that I am myself
the fortunate possessor of forty pieces, (the complete series of the
first edition, excepting one,) which are printed with the greatest
clearness and brilliancy of effect, on one side of the paper only; each
cut having over it its title, printed in the German language with
moveable type. It is possible that they may originally have had verses
underneath, and texts of Scripture above, in addition to the titles just
mentioned: but as the margins are clipped on the sides and at bottom, it
is now impossible to ascertain the fact.”<a class = "tag" name =
"tagVI12" id = "tagVI12" href = "#noteVI12">VI.12</a></p>

<p>Had the forty impressions in question been accompanied with verses
and texts of Scripture, they certainly might be considered as having
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page333" id = "page333">
333</a></span>
belonged to an earlier edition of the work than that of 1538, and for
the existence of which Mr. Ottley has referred to the testimony of
Jansen and the editor of the Notices sur les Graveurs, printed at
Besançon. There is, however, a&nbsp;set of those cuts preserved in the
public library at Basle, which seems clearly to prove that they had only
been taken as specimens without any further accompaniment than the
titles. They are printed on four folio leaves, on only one side of the
paper, and there are ten cuts on each page; the title, in the German
language, and in Italic type, like Mr. Ottley’s, is printed above each;
and the same cut&mdash;that of the astrologer&mdash;is also wanting.
From these circumstances there can scarcely be a doubt that the set
formerly belonging to Mr. Ottley<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI13" id =
"tagVI13" href = "#noteVI13">VI.13</a> had been printed in the same
manner, and that each impression had subsequently been cut out, perhaps
for the purpose of mounting them singly. The following are the titles
given to those cuts, and to each is subjoined a literal translation.
They are numbered as they follow each other in <span class =

<p>In 1542 a second edition of the Dance of Death, with the same cuts as
the first, was published at Lyons, “Soubz l’escu de Coloigne,” by John
and Francis Frellon, who appear to have succeeded to the business of the
brothers Trechsel,&mdash;if, indeed, the latter were not merely the
printers of the first edition. In a third edition, with the title
Imagines Mortis, 1545, the verses underneath each cut are in Latin.<a
class = "tag" name = "tagVI14" id = "tagVI14" href =
"#noteVI14">VI.14</a> A&nbsp;cut of a lame beggar, which has no relation
to the Dance of Death, is introduced as a tail-piece to one of the
discourses on death&mdash;Cypriani Sermo de Mortalitate&mdash;at the end
of the volume; but it is neither designed nor executed in the same style
as the others.</p>

<p>In a fourth edition, with the title “Imagines Mortis,”<a class =
"tag" name = "tagVI15" id = "tagVI15" href = "#noteVI15">VI.15</a> 1547,
eleven additional cuts are introduced; namely: 1.&nbsp;Death fighting
with a soldier in Swiss costume; 2.&nbsp;Gamblers, with a figure of
Death, and another of the Devil; 3.&nbsp;Drunkards, with a figure of
Death; 4.&nbsp;The Fool, with a figure of Death playing on the bagpipes;
5.&nbsp;The Robber seized by Death; 6.&nbsp;The Blind Man and Death;
7.&nbsp;The Waggoner and Death; 8.&nbsp;Children, one of whom is borne
on the shoulders of the others as a conqueror triumphing; 9.&nbsp;A
child with a shield and dart; 10.&nbsp;Three children; one riding on an
arrow, another on a bow, as on a hobby-horse, the third carrying a hare
over his shoulder, suspended from a hunting pole; 11.&nbsp;Children as
Bacchanalians. The last four subjects have no relation to a Dance of
Death, but have evidently been introduced merely to increase the number
of the cuts; they are, however, beautifully designed and well engraved.
This edition contains twelve more cuts, reckoning the tail-piece of the
Lame Beggar, than the first. Another edition, forming the fifth, was
also published in 1547 under the title of “Les Images de la
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page335" id = "page335">
335</a></span>
Mort,” with French verses, as in the edition of 1538. The number of cuts
is the same as in the edition of 1547 with Latin verses, and the title
“Imagines Mortis,” or “Icones Mortis.”</p>

<p>In 1549, a sixth edition, with the same number of cuts as the last,
was published, under the title of “Simolachri, Historie, e&nbsp;Figure
de la Morte,” with the letter-press in Italian, with the exception of
the texts of Scripture, which were in Latin, as in the others. In the
preface, John Frellon&mdash;whose name appears alone in the edition of
1547, and in those of subsequent years&mdash;complains of a piracy of
the book, which was printed at Venice in 1545, with fac-similes of the
cuts of the first edition. “Frellon, by way of revenge,” says Mr. Douce,
“and to save the trouble of making a new translation of the articles
that compose the volume, made use of that of his Italian competitor.”<a
class = "tag" name = "tagVI16" id = "tagVI16" href =
"#noteVI16">VI.16</a> A&nbsp;seventh edition, with the title “Icones
Mortis,” and containing fifty-three cuts, appeared, without any
printer’s name, in 1554.</p>

<p>In an eighth edition, 1562, with the title “Les Images de la Mort,
auxquelles sont adjoustees dix-sept figures,” five additional cuts are
introduced, thus making seventeen more than are contained in the first.
The total number of cuts in the edition of 1562 is fifty-eight; and that
of the Lame Beggar, which first appeared as a tail-piece in the edition
of 1545, has now a place among the others in the body of the book. The
subjects of the five new cuts are: 1.&nbsp;The Husband, with a figure of
Death; 2.&nbsp;The Wife,&mdash;Death leading a young woman by the hand,
preceded by a young man playing on a kind of guitar; 3.&nbsp;Children as
part of a triumph, one of them as a warrior on horseback; 4.&nbsp;Three
children; one with a trophy of armour, another carrying a vase and a
shield, the third seated naked on the ground; 5.&nbsp;Children with
musical instruments. The subjects of children are designed and executed
in the same style as those first introduced in the edition of 1547. The
last of those five new cuts does not appear in regular order with the
other fifty-seven; but is given as a tail-piece at the end of a preface
to a devotional tract&mdash;La Medicine de l’Ame&mdash;in the latter
part of the book. Mr. Douce mentions another edition with the date 1574.
He, however, observes in a note: “This edition is given on the authority
of Peignot,<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI17" id = "tagVI17" href =
"#noteVI17">VI.17</a> page 62, but has not been seen by the author of
this work. In the year 1547 there were three editions, and it is not
improbable that, by the transposition of the two last figures, one of
these might have been intended.” As one of Mr. Douce’s <i>three</i>
editions of 1547 differs only
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page336" id = "page336">
336</a></span>
from another of the same date by having “<i>Icones</i>” instead of
“<i>Imagines</i>” in the title-page, he might as consistently have
claimed a fourth for the same year on the ground of a <i>probable</i>
transposition of 74 for 47. All the authentic editions of the “Dance of
Death,” previously noticed, were published at Lyons. The first, as has
been already observed, was in small quarto; the others are described by
Mr. Douce as being in duodecimo. In a Dutch Dance of Death, intitled “De
Doodt vermaskert met swerelts ydelheit,” duodecimo, Antwerp, 1654,
fourteen of the cuts, according to Mr. Douce, were from the original
blocks which had been used in the Lyons editions.</p>

<p>It seems probable that the earliest copies of the cuts in “Les
Simulachres et Historiées Faces de la Mort,” or Dance of Death, as the
work is more frequently called, appeared in a small folio, intitled
“Todtentantz,” printed at Augsburg in 1544, by “<i>Jobst Denecker,
Formschneyder</i>.” As I have never seen a copy of this edition,
I&nbsp;take the liberty of extracting the following notice of it from
Mr. Douce: “This edition is not only valuable from its extreme rarity,
but for the very accurate and spirited manner in which the fine original
cuts are copied. It contains all the subjects that were then published,
but not arranged as those had been. It has the addition of one singular
print, intitled, ‘Der Eebrecher,’ <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the Adulterer,
representing a man discovering the adulterer in bed with his wife, and
plunging his sword through both of them, Death guiding his hands. On the
opposite page to each engraving there is a dialogue between Death and
the party, and at bottom a Latin hexameter. The subject of the Pleader
has the unknown mark <img class = "middle" src = "images/illus_336.png"
width = "30" height = "20" alt = "symbol"> and on that of the Duchess in
bed, there is the date 1542.”<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI18" id =
"tagVI18" href = "#noteVI18">VI.18</a> Mr. Douce is of opinion that the
“<i>Jobst Denecker, Formschneyder</i>,” who appears as the printer, was
the same person as Jobst or Jost de Negker, the wood engraver whose name
is at the back of one of the cuts of the Triumphal Procession of
Maximilian.&mdash;The next copy of the work is that intitled
“Simolachri, Historie, e&nbsp;Figure de la Morte,” Venice, 1545, the
piracy complained of by Frellon in his Italian edition of 1549. It
contains forty-one cuts, as in the first Lyons edition of 1538. There is
no variation in the figures; but the expression of the faces is
frequently lost, and the general execution of the whole is greatly
inferior to that of the originals. Another edition, in Latin, was
published in 1546; and Mr. Douce says that there are impressions of the
cuts on single sheets, at the bottom of one of which is the date
1568.&mdash;In 1555, an edition with the title “Imagines Mortis,” with
fifty-three cuts, similar to those in the Lyons edition of 1547, was
published at Cologne by the heirs of Arnold Birkman, Cologne, 1555; and
there are four other editions of the same work, respectively dated 1557,
1566, 1567, and 1572. Alterations are
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page337" id = "page337">
337</a></span>
made in some of those cuts; in five of them the mark <img class =
"middle" src = "images/illus_337a.png" width = "28" height = "21" alt =
"SA"> is introduced; and in the cut of the Duchess the mark <img class =
"middle" src = "images/illus_337b.png" width = "19" height = "17" alt =
"symbol">, seen on the bed-frame in the original, is omitted. All the
alterations are for the worse; some of the figures seem like caricatures
of the originals; and the cuts generally are, in point of execution,
very inferior to those in the Lyons editions. The name of the artist to
whom the mark <img class = "middle" src = "images/illus_337a.png" width
= "28" height = "21" alt = "SA"> belongs is unknown. In the preface to
the Emblems of Mortality, page xx, the writer says it is “that of <span
class = "smallcaps">Silvius Antonianus</span>, an artist of considerable
merit.” This, however, is merely one of the blunders of Papillon, who,
according to Mr. Douce, has converted the owner of this mark into a
cardinal. Papillon, it would seem, had observed it on the cuts of an
edition of Faerno’s Fables&mdash;printed at Antwerp, 1567, and dedicated
to Cardinal Borromeo by Silvio Antoniano, professor of Belles Lettres at
Rome, afterwards a cardinal himself&mdash;and without hesitation he
concluded that the editor was the engraver.<a class = "tag" name =
"tagVI19" id = "tagVI19" href = "#noteVI19">VI.19</a> The last of the
editions published in the sixteenth century with wood-cuts copied from
the Lyons work, appeared at Wittemberg in 1590.</p>

<p>Various editions of the Dance of Death, with copper-plate engravings
generally copied from the work published at Lyons, are enumerated by Mr.
Douce, but only one of them seems to require notice here. Between 1647
and 1651 Hollar etched thirty subjects from the Dance of Death,
introducing occasionally a few alterations. From a careful examination
of those etchings, I&nbsp;am inclined to think that most of them were
copied not from the cuts in any of the Lyons editions, but from those in
the edition published by the heirs of Birkman at Cologne. The original
copper-plates of Hollar’s thirty etchings having come into the
possession of Mr. James Edwards, formerly a bookseller in Pall-Mall, he
published an edition in duodecimo, without date, but about 1794,<a class
= "tag" name = "tagVI20" id = "tagVI20" href = "#noteVI20">VI.20</a>
with preliminary observations on the Dance of Death, written by the late
Mr. F.&nbsp;Douce. Those preliminary observations are the germ of Mr.
Douce’s beautiful and more complete volume, published by
W.&nbsp;Pickering in 1833 (and republished with additions by Mr. Bohn in
1858). As Petrarch’s amatory sonnets and poems have been called
“a&nbsp;labour of Love,” with equal
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page338" id = "page338">
338</a></span>
propriety may Mr. Douce’s last work be intitled “a&nbsp;labour of
Death.” Scarcely a cut or an engraving that contains even a death’s head
and cross-bones appears to have escaped his notice. Incorporated is a
<i>Catalogue raisonné</i> which contains an enumeration of all the
tomb-stones in England and Wales that are ornamented with those standard
“Emblems of Mortality,”&mdash;skull, thigh-bones in saltire, and
hour-glass. In his last “Opus Magnum Mortis,” the notices of the several
Dances of Death in various parts of Europe are very much enlarged, but
he has not been able to adduce any further arguments or evidences beyond
what appeared in his first essay, to show that the cuts in the original
edition of the Dance of Death, published at Lyons, were not designed by
Holbein. Throughout the work there are undeniable proofs of the
diligence of the collector; but no evidences of a mind that could make
them available to a useful end. He is at once sceptical and credulous;
he denies that any poet of the name of Macaber ever lived; and yet he
believes, on the sole authority of one T.&nbsp;Nieuhoff Picard, whose
existence is as doubtful as Macaber’s, that Holbein painted a Dance of
Death as large as life, in fresco, in the old palace at Whitehall.</p>

<p>Having now given a list of all the authentic editions of the Dance of
Death and of the principal copies of it, I&nbsp;shall next, before
saying anything about the supposed designer or engraver, lay before the
reader a few specimens of the original cuts. Mr. Douce observes, of the
forty-nine cuts given in his Dance of Death, 1833, that “they may be
very justly regarded as scarcely distinguishable from their fine
originals.” Now, without any intention of depreciating these clever
copies, I&nbsp;must pronounce them inferior to the originals, especially
in the heads and hands. In this respect the wood-cuts of the first Lyons
edition of the Dance of Death are unrivalled by any other productions of
the art of wood engraving, either in past or present times. In the
present day, when mere delicacy of cutting in the modern French taste is
often mistaken for good engraving, there are doubtless many admirers of
the art who fancy that there would be no difficulty in finding a wood
engraver who might be fully competent to accurately copy the originals
in the first edition of the Dance of Death. The experiment, however,
would probably convince the undertaker of such a task, whoever he might
be, that he had in this instance over-rated his abilities. Let the heads
in the Lyons cuts, and those of any copies of them, old or recent, be
examined with a magnifying glass, and the excellence of the former will
appear still more decidedly than when viewed with the naked eye.</p>

<p>The following cut is a copy of the same size as the original, which
is the second of the Dance of Death, of the edition of 1538. The subject
is Adam and Eve eating of the forbidden fruit; and in the series of
early impressions, formerly Mr. Ottley’s, but now in the Print Room of
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page339" id = "page339">
339</a></span>
the British Museum, it is intitled “<i>Adam Eva im
Paradyss</i>”&mdash;Adam and Eve in Paradise. The serpent, as in many
other old engravings, as well as in paintings, is represented with a
human face. In order to convey an idea of the original page, this cut is
accompanied with its explanatory text and verses printed in similar
type.</p>

<p class = "illustration">
<a name = "illus_339" id = "illus_339">&nbsp;</a>

alt = "see text"></p>

<p class = "right">
<a class = "mynote" href = "#note_6a">Text within illustration</a></p>

<p>In the two first cuts, which represent the Creation of Eve, and Adam
taking the forbidden fruit, the figure of Death is not seen. In the
third, Adam and Eve driven out of Paradise, Death, playing on a kind of
lyre, is seen preceding them; and in the fourth, Adam cultivating the
earth, Death is perceived assisting him in his labour. In the fifth,
intitled <i>Gebeyn aller menschen</i>&mdash;Skeletons of all
men&mdash;in the early impressions of the cuts, formerly belonging to
Mr. Ottley, but now in the British Museum, all the figures are
skeletons; one of them is seen beating a pair of kettle drums, while
others are sounding trumpets, as if rejoicing
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page340" id = "page340">
340</a></span>
in the power which had been given to Death in consequence of the fall of
man. The texts above this cut are, “Væ væ væ habitantibus in terra.
<span class = "smallcaps">Apocalypsis viii</span>;” and “Cuncta in
quibus spiraculum vitæ est, mortua sunt. <span class =
"smallcaps">Genesis vii.</span>” In the sixth cut there are two figures
of Death,&mdash;one grinning at the pope as he bestows the crown on a
kneeling emperor, and the other, wearing a cardinal’s hat, as a witness
of the ceremony. In the thirty-sixth cut, the Duchess, there are two
figures of Death introduced, and there are also two in the
thirty-seventh, the Pedlar; but in all the others of this edition, from
the seventh to the thirty-ninth, inclusive, there is only a single
figure of Death, and in every instance his action and expression are
highly comic, most distinctly evincing that man’s destruction is his
sport. In the fortieth cut there is no figure of Death; the Deity seated
on a rainbow, with his feet resting on the globe, is seen pronouncing
final judgment on the human race. The forty-first, and last cut of the
original edition, represents Death’s coat-of-arms&mdash;&mdash;<i>Die
wapen des Thots</i>. On an escutcheon, which is rent in several places,
is a death’s-head, with something like a large worm proceeding from the
mouth; above the escutcheon, a&nbsp;barred helmet, seen in front like
that of a sovereign prince, is probably intended to represent the power
of Death; the crest is a pair of fleshless arms holding something like a
large stone immediately above an hour-glass; on the dexter side of the
escutcheon stands a gentleman, who seems to be calling the attention of
the spectator to this memento of Death, and on the opposite side is a
lady; in the distance are Alpine mountains, the top of the highest
partly shaded by a cloud. The appropriate text is, “Memorare novissima,
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page341" id = "page341">
341</a></span>
et in æternum non peccabis. <span class = "smallcaps">Eccle.

<div class = "verse">

<p>Et point ne seras empesché</p>

<p>The total number of cuts of the first edition in which Death is seen
attending on men and women of all ranks and conditions, mocking them,
seizing them, slaying them, or merrily leading them to their end, is
thirty-seven.</p>

while he

pretends to support him and to amuse him with the music of a dulcimer.

<p>The following cut is a copy of the thirty-sixth, the
Duchess&mdash;<i>Die Hertzoginn</i>. In this cut, as has been previously
observed, there are two figures of Death; one rouses her from the
bed&mdash;where she appears to have been indulging in an afternoon
nap&mdash;by pulling off the coverlet, while the other treats her to a
tune on the violin. On the frame of the bed, or couch, to the left, near
the bottom of the cut, is seen the mark <img class = "middle" src =

has not a little increased the difficulty of arriving at any clear and

<p>The following cut, the Child&mdash;<i>Das Iung Kint</i>&mdash;is a
copy of the thirty-ninth, and the last but two in the original edition.
Death having been represented in the preceding cuts as beguiling men and
women in court and council-chamber, in bed-room and hall, in street and
field, by sea and by land, is here represented as visiting the
dilapidated cottage of the poor, and, while the mother is engaged in
cooking, seizing her youngest child.</p>

<p>The cut of the Waggon overturned, from which the following is copied,
first appeared with ten others in the edition of 1547. From an
inspection of this cut, which most probably is that mentioned as being
left unfinished, in the prefatory address to Madame Jehanne de Touszele
in the first edition, 1538, it will be perceived that the description
which is there given of it is not correct, and hence arises
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page344" id = "page344">
344</a></span>
a doubt if the writer had actually seen it. He describes the driver as
knocked down, and lying bruised under his broken waggon, and he says
that the figure of Death is perceived roguishly sucking the wine out of
a broken cask by means of a reed.<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI21" id =
"tagVI21" href = "#noteVI21">VI.21</a> In the cut itself, however, the
waggoner is seen standing, wringing his hands as if in despair on
account of the accident, and a figure of Death,&mdash;for there are two
in this cut,&mdash;instead of sucking the wine, appears to be engaged in
undoing the rope or chain by which the cask is secured to the waggon.
A&nbsp;second figure of Death is perceived carrying off one of the
waggon-wheels. In this cut the subject is not so well
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page345" id = "page345">
345</a></span>
treated as in most of those in the edition of 1538; and it is also not
so well engraved.&mdash;The text and verses annexed are from the edition
of 1562.</p>

<p>Of the eleven additional cuts inserted in the edition of 1547, there
are four of children, which, as has already been observed in page 334,
have not the slightest connexion with the Dance of Death. The following
is a copy of one of them. The editor seems to have found no difficulty
in providing the subject with a text; and it serves as a peg to hang a
quatrain on as well as the others which contain personi&shy;fications of
Death.</p>

<p>In the edition of 1562 five more cuts are inserted; but two of them
only&mdash;the Bridegroom and the Bride&mdash;have relation to the Dance
of Death; the other three are of a similar character to the four cuts of
children first inserted in the edition of 1547. All the seven cuts of
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page346" id = "page346">
346</a></span>
children have been evidently designed by the same person. They are well
engraved, but not in so masterly a style as the forty-one cuts of the
original edition. The following is a copy of one of the three which were
inserted in the edition of 1562.</p>

<p>Having now given what, perhaps, may be considered a sufficiently
ample account of the Lyons Dance of Death, it next appears necessary to
make some enquiries respecting the designer of the cuts. Until the
publication of Mr. Douce’s observations, prefixed to the edition of
Hollar’s etchings from those cuts, by Edwards, about 1794, scarcely any
writer who mentions them seems to entertain a doubt of their having been
designed by Holbein; and Papillon, in his usual manner, claims him as a
wood engraver, and unhesitatingly declares that not only the cuts of the
Lyons Dance of Death, but all the other cuts which are generally
supposed to have been of his designing, were engraved by himself. Mr.
Douce’s arguments are almost entirely negative,&mdash;for he produces no
satisfactory evidence to show that those cuts were certainly
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page347" id = "page347">
347</a></span>
designed by some other artist,&mdash;and they are chiefly founded on the
passage in the first Lyons edition, where the writer speaks of the death
of the person “qui nous en a icy imaginé si elegantes figures.”</p>

<p>The sum of Mr. Douce’s objections to Holbein being the designer of
the cuts in question is as follows. “The singularity of this curious and
interesting dedication is deserving of the utmost attention. It seems
very strongly, if not decisively, to point out the edition to which it
is prefixed, as the first; and what is of still more importance, to
deprive Holbein of any claim to the invention of the work. It most
certainly uses such terms of art as can scarcely be mistaken as
conveying any other sense than that of originality of design. There
cannot be words of plainer import than those which describe the painter,
as he is expressly called, <i>delineating</i> the subjects and leaving
several of them unfinished: and whoever the artist might have been, it
clearly appears that he was not living in 1538. Now, it is well known
that Holbein’s death did not take place before the year 1554, during the
plague which ravaged London at that time. If then the expressions used
in this dedication signify anything, it may surely be asked what becomes
of any claim on the part of Holbein to the designs of the work in
question, or does it not <i>at least</i> remain in a situation of doubt
and difficulty?”<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI22" id = "tagVI22" href =
"#noteVI22">VI.22</a> With respect to the true import of the passage
referred to, my opinion is almost directly the reverse of that expressed
by Mr. Douce.</p>

<p>What the writer of the address to Madame Jehanne de Touszele, in the
Lyons edition of 1538, says respecting the unfinished cuts, taken all
together, seems to relate more properly to the engraver than the
designer; more especially when we find that a cut&mdash;that of the
Waggoner,&mdash;expressly noticed by him as being then unfinished, was
given with others of a similar character in a subsequent edition.</p>

<p>From the incorrect manner in which the cut of the Waggoner is
described, I&nbsp;am very much inclined to think that the writer had
neither seen the original nor the other subjects already
traced&mdash;the “<i>plusieurs aultres figures jà par luy
trassées</i>”&mdash;of whose “bold drawing, perspectives, and shadows,”
he speaks in such terms of admiration. If the writer knew little of the
process of wood engraving, he would be very likely to commit the mistake
of supposing that the engraver was also the designer of the cuts. Though
I consider it by no means unlikely that the engraver might have been
dead before the publication of the first edition, yet I am very much
inclined to believe that the passage in which the cuts are mentioned is
purposely involved in obscurity: the writer, while he speaks of the
deceased artist in terms of the highest commendation, at the same time
carefully conceals his name. If the account in the preface be admitted
as correct, it would
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page348" id = "page348">
348</a></span>
appear that the cuts were both designed and engraved by the same person,
and that those already drawn on the block<a class = "tag" name =
"tagVI23" id = "tagVI23" href = "#noteVI23">VI.23</a> remained
unfinished in consequence of his decease; for if he were <i>not</i> the
engraver, what prevented the execution of the other subjects already
traced, and of which the bold drawing, perspective, and shadows, all so
gracefully delineated, are distinctly mentioned? The engraver, whoever
he might be, was certainly not only the best of his age, but continues
unsurpassed to the present day, and I am satisfied that such precision
of line as is seen in the heads could only be acquired by great
practice. The designs are so excellent in drawing and composition, and
so admirably are the different characters represented,&mdash;with such
spirit, humour, and appropriate expression,&mdash;that to have produced
them would confer additional honour on even the greatest painters of
that or any other period. Are we then to suppose that those excellencies
of design and of engraving were combined in an obscure individual whose
name is not to be found in the roll of fame, who lived comparatively
unknown, and whose death is only incidentally noticed in an ambiguous
preface written by a nameless pedant, and professedly addressed to an
abbess whose very existence is questionable?<a class = "tag" name =
"tagVI24" id = "tagVI24" href = "#noteVI24">VI.24</a> Such a supposition
I conceive to be in the highest degree improbable; and, on the contrary,
I&nbsp;am perfectly satisfied that the cuts in question were <i>not</i>
designed and engraved by the same person. Furthermore, admitting the
address to Madame Jehanne de Touszele to be written in good faith,
I&nbsp;am firmly of opinion that the person whose death is there
mentioned, was the engraver, and not the designer of the cuts of the
first edition.</p>

<p>The mark <img class = "middle" src = "images/illus_342b.png" width =
"29" height = "21" alt = "HL"> in the cut of the Duchess, is certainly
not Holbein’s; and Mr. Douce says, “that it was intended to express the
name of the designer, cannot be supported by evidence of any kind.” That
it is not the mark of the designer, I&nbsp;agree with Mr. Douce, but my
conclusion is drawn from premises directly the reverse of his; for had I
not found evidence elsewhere to convince me that this mark can only be
that of the engraver, I&nbsp;should most certainly have concluded that
it was intended for the mark of the designer. In direct opposition to
what Mr. Douce here says, up to the time of the publication of the Lyons
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page349" id = "page349">
349</a></span>
Dance of Death, the mark on wood-cuts is most frequently that of the
designer, and whenever that of the engraver appears, it is as an
exception to the general custom. It is, in fact, upon the evidence of
the mark alone that the greater part of the wood-cut designs of Durer,
Cranach, Burgmair, Behaim, Baldung, Grün, and other old masters, are
respectively ascribed to them. The cuts of the Triumphal Procession of
Maximilian with Hans Burgmair’s mark in front, and the names of the
engravers written at the back of the blocks, may serve as an
illustration of the general practice, which is directly the reverse of
Mr. Douce’s opinion. If the weight of probability be not on the opposite
side, the mark in question ought certainly, according to the usual
practice of the period, to be considered as that of the designer.</p>

<p>In a subsequent page of the same chapter, Mr. Douce most
inconsistently says, “There is an unfortunate ambiguity connected with
the marks that are found on ancient engravings on wood, and it has been
a <i>very great error</i> on the part of all the writers who treat on
such engravings, in referring the marks that accompany them to the
block-cutters, or as the Germans properly denominate them the
<i>formschneiders</i>, whilst, perhaps, the greatest part of them really
belong to the designers.” He commits in the early part of the chapter
the very error which he ascribes to others. According to his own
principles, as expressed in the last extract, he was bound to allow the
mark <img class = "middle" src = "images/illus_342b.png" width = "29"
height = "21" alt = "HL"> to be that of the designer until he could show
on probable grounds that it was not. But though Mr. Douce might deny
that Holbein were the designer of those cuts, it seems that he durst not
venture to follow up the line of his argument, and declare that Hans
Lutzelburger <i>was</i> the designer, which he certainly might have done
with at least as much reason as has led him to decide that Holbein
<i>was not</i>. But he prudently abstained from venturing on such an
affirmation, the improbability of which, notwithstanding the mark, might
have led his readers to inquire, how it happened that so talented an
artist should have remained so long undiscovered, and that even his
contemporaries should not have known him as the designer of those
subjects.</p>

<p>Though I am satisfied that the mark <img class = "middle" src =
"images/illus_342b.png" width = "29" height = "21" alt = "HL"> is that
of the <i>engraver</i> of the cuts in the first edition of the Lyons
Dance of Death, I&nbsp;by no means pretend to account for its appearing
alone&mdash;thus forming an exception to the general rule&mdash;without
the mark of the designer, and without any mention of his name either in
the title or preface to the book. We have no knowledge of the connexion
in the way of business between the working wood engravers and the
designers of that period; but there seems reason to believe that the
former sometimes got drawings made at their own expense and risk, and,
when engraved, either published them on their own account, or disposed
of them to booksellers and printers. It is
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page350" id = "page350">
350</a></span>
also to be observed that about the time of the publication of the first
Lyons edition of the Dance of Death, or a few years before, wood
engravers began to occasionally introduce their name or mark into the
cut, in addition to that of the designer. A&nbsp;cut, in a German
translation of Cicero de Officiis, Frankfort, 1538, contains two marks;
one of them being that of Hans Sebald Behaim, and the other, the letters
H.&nbsp;W., which I take to be that of the engraver. At a later period
this practice became more frequent, and a considerable number of
wood-cuts executed between 1540 and 1580 contain two marks; one of the
designer, and the other of the engraver: in wood-cuts designed by Virgil
Solis in particular, double marks are of frequent occurrence. As it
seems evident that the publishers of the Lyons Dance of Death were
desirous of concealing the name of the designer, and as it appears
likely that they had purchased the cuts ready engraved from a Swiss or a
German,&mdash;for the designs are certainly not French,&mdash;it surely
cannot be surprising that he should wish to affix his mark to those most
admirable specimens of art. Moreover, if those cuts were not executed
under the personal superintendence of the designer, but when he was
chiefly resident in a distant country, the engraver would thus have the
uncontrolled liberty of inserting his own mark; and more especially, if
those cuts were a private speculation of his own, and not executed for a
publisher who had employed an artist to make the designs. Another
reason, perhaps equally us good as any of the foregoing, might be
suggested; as those cuts are decidedly the best executed of any of that
period, the designer&mdash;even if he had opportunities of seeing the
proofs&mdash;might have permitted the mark of the engraver to appear on
one of them, in approbation of his talent.</p>

<p>This mark, <img class = "middle" src = "images/illus_342b.png" width
= "29" height = "21" alt = "HL">, was first assigned to a wood engraver
named Hans Lutzelburger, by M.&nbsp;Christian von Mechel,
a&nbsp;celebrated engraver of Basle, who in 1780 published forty-five
copper-plate engravings of a Dance of Death from drawings said to be by
Holbein, and which almost in every respect agree with the corresponding
cuts in the Lyons work, though of greater size.<a class = "tag" name =
"tagVI25" id = "tagVI25" href = "#noteVI25">VI.25</a> M.&nbsp;Mechel’s
conjecture respecting the
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page351" id = "page351">
351</a></span>
engraver of those cuts appears to have been first published in the
sixteenth volume of Von Murr’s Journal; but though I am inclined to
think that he is correct, it has not been satisfactorily shown that Hans
Lutzelburger ever used the mark <img class = "middle" src =
"images/illus_342b.png" width = "29" height = "21" alt = "HL">. He,
however, lived at that period, and it is almost certain that he executed
an alphabet of small initial letters representing a Dance of Death,
which appear to have been first used at Basle by the printers Bebelius
and Cratander about 1530. We give (on&nbsp;the following page) the
entire series. He is also supposed to have engraved two other alphabets
of ornamental initial letters, one representing a dance of peasants,
“intermixed,” says Mr. Douce, “with other subjects, some of which are
not of the most delicate nature;” the other representing groups of
children in various playful attitudes. All those three alphabets are
generally described by German and Swiss writers on art as having been
designed by Holbein; and few impartial persons I conceive can have much
doubt on the subject, if almost perfect identity between most of the
figures and those in his known productions be allowed to have any
weight.</p>

<p>There is a set of proofs of the alphabet of the Dance of Death,
printed on one sheet, preserved in the Public Library at Basle, and
underneath is printed in moveable letters the name <span class =
"blackletter">HAnns Lützelburger formschnider, genannt
Franck</span>,&mdash;that is, “Hanns Lutzelburger, wood engraver, named
Franck.” The first H is an ornamented Roman capital; the other letters
of the name are in the German character. The size of the cuts in this
alphabet of the Dance of Death is one inch by seven-eighths. The reason
for supposing that Hans Lutzelburger was the engraver of the cuts in the
first edition of the Lyons Dance of Death are: 1.&nbsp;The similarity of
style between the latter and those of the Basle alphabet of the same
subject; and 2.&nbsp;The correspondence of the mark in the cut of the
Duchess with the initial letters of the name H[ans] L[utzelburger], and
the fact of his being a wood engraver of that period. Mr. Douce, in the
seventh chapter of his work, professes to
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page353" id = "page353">
353</a></span>
examine the “claim of Hans Lutzelburger as to the design or execution of
the Lyons engravings of the Dance of Death,” but his investigations seem
very unsatisfactory; and his chapter is one of those “in which,” as
Fielding says, “nothing is concluded.” He gives no opinion as to whether
Lutzelburger was the designer of the Lyons cuts or not, though this is
one of the professed topics of his investigation; and even his opinion,
for the time being, as to the engraver, only appears in the heading of
the following chapter, where it is thus announced: “<i>List of several
editions of the Lyons work on the Dance of Death, with the mark of
Lutzenburger</i>.”<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI26" id = "tagVI26" href
= "#noteVI26">VI.26</a> His mind, however, does not appear to have been
finally made up on this point; for in a subsequent page, 215, speaking
of the mark <img class = "middle" src = "images/illus_342b.png" width =
"29" height = "21" alt = "HL"> in the cut of the Duchess, which he had
previously mentioned as that of Hans Lutzelburger, he says, “<i>but to
whomsoever this mark may turn out to belong</i>, certain it is that
Holbein never made use of it.” His only unalterable decision appears to
be that Holbein did not design the cuts of the Lyons Dance of Death, and
in support of it he puts forth sundry arguments which are at once absurd
and inconsistent; rejects unquestionable evidence which makes for the
contrary opinion; and admits the most improbable that seems to favour
his own.</p>

<p>Mr. Douce, in his seventh chapter, also gives a list of cuts, which
he says were executed by Hans Lutzelburger; but out of the seven single
cuts and three alphabets which he enumerates, I&nbsp;am inclined to
think that Lutzelburger’s name is only to be found attached to one
single cut and to one alphabet,&mdash;the latter being that of the
initial letters representing a Dance of Death. The single cut to which I
allude&mdash;and which, I&nbsp;believe, is the only one of the kind that
has his name underneath it,&mdash;represents a combat in a wood between
some naked men and a body of peasants. Within the cut, to the left, is
the mark, probably of the designer, on a reversed tablet, <img class =
"middle" src = "images/illus_353.png" width = "76" height = "31" alt =
"symbol"> thus; and underneath is the following inscription, from a
separate block: <span class = "smallcaps">Hanns . Leuczellburger .
Furmschnider</span> × 1.5.2.2. An impression of this cut is preserved in
the Public Library at Basle; and an alphabet of Roman capitals, engraved
on wood, is printed on the same folio, below Lutzelburger’s name. In not
one of the other single cuts does this engraver’s name occur, nor in
fact any mark that can be fairly ascribed to him. The seventh cut,
described by Mr. Douce,&mdash;a copy of Albert Durer’s Decollation of
John the Baptist,&mdash;is ascribed to Lutzelburger on the authority of
Zani. According to this writer,&mdash;for I have not seen the cut myself
any more than Mr. Douce,&mdash;it has “the mark H.&nbsp;L. reversed,”
which perhaps may prove to be L.&nbsp;H. “In the index of names,” says
Mr. Douce, “he (Zani) finds his name thus written, <span class =
"smallcaps">Hans</span>
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page354" id = "page354">
354</a></span>
<span class = "smallcaps">Lutzelburger Formschnider genant</span>
(chiamato) <span class = "smallcaps">Franck</span>, and calls him the
true prince of engravers on wood.” In what index Zani found the reversed
mark thus expounded does not appear; I, however, am decidedly of opinion
that there is no wood-cut in existence with the mark H.&nbsp;L. which
can be ascribed with anything like certainty to Lutzelburger; and his
name is only to be found at length <i>under</i> the cut of the Fight
above mentioned, and printed in moveable characters on the sheet
containing the proofs of the alphabet of the Dance of Death.<a class =
"tag" name = "tagVI27" id = "tagVI27" href = "#noteVI27">VI.27</a> The
title of “true prince of engravers on wood,” given by Zani to
Lutzelburger, can only be admitted on the supposition of his being the
engraver of the cuts in the first edition of the Lyons Dance of Death;
but it yet remains to be proved that he ever used the mark <img class =
"middle" src = "images/illus_342b.png" width = "29" height = "21" alt =
"HL"> or the separate letters H.&nbsp;L. on any previous or subsequent
cut. Though, from his name appearing on the page containing the alphabet
of the Dance of Death, and from the correspondence of his initials with
the mark in the cut of the Duchess in the Lyons Dance of Death,
I&nbsp;am inclined to think that he was the engraver of the cuts in the
latter work, yet I have thought it necessary to enter thus fully into
the grounds of his pretensions to the execution of those, and other wood
engravings, in order that the reader may judge for himself.</p>

<p>Hegner, in his Life of Holbein, treats the claims that have been
advanced on behalf of Lutzelburger too lightly. He not only denies that
he was the engraver of the cuts in the first edition of the Lyons work,
but also that he executed the cuts of the alphabet of the Dance of
Death, although his name with the addition of “wood
engraver”&mdash;<i>formschnider</i>&mdash;be printed on the sheet of
proofs. If we cannot admit the inscription in question as evidence of
Lutzelburger being the engraver of this alphabet, we may with equal
reason question if any wood engraver actually executed the cut or cuts
under which his name only appears printed in type, or which may be
ascribed to him in the title of a book. Mr. Douce, speaking of the three
alphabets,&mdash;of peasants, boys, and a Dance of Death,&mdash;all of
which he supposes to have been engraved by Lutzelburger, says that the
proofs “may have been deposited by him in his <i>native</i> city,”
meaning Basle. Hegner, however, says that there is no trace of him to be
found either in registers of baptism or burger-lists of Basle. He
further adds, though I by no means concur with him in this opinion, “It
is indeed likely that, as a travelling dealer in works of art&mdash;who,
according to the custom of that period, took up their temporary
residence sometimes in one place, sometimes in another,&mdash;he had
obtained possession of those blocks, [of the alphabet of Death’s Dance,
and the Fight, with his name,] and that he sold impressions from them in
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page355" id = "page355">
355</a></span>
the way of trade.”<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI28" id = "tagVI28" href
= "#noteVI28">VI.28</a> Mr. Douce says that it may admit of a doubt
whether the alphabets ascribed to Lutzelburger were cut on metal or on
wood. It may admit of a doubt, certainly, with one who knows very little
of the practice of wood engraving, but none with a person who is
accustomed to see cuts executed in a much more delicate style by wood
engravers of very moderate abilities. To engrave them on wood, would be
comparatively easy, so far as relates to the mere delicacy of the lines;
but it would be a task of great difficulty to engrave them in relief in
any metal which should be much harder than that of which types are
composed. To suppose that they might have been executed in type-metal,
on account of the delicacy of the lines, would involve a contradiction;
for not only can finer lines be cut on box-wood than on type-metal, but
also with much greater facility.</p>

<p>It perhaps may not be unnecessary to give here two instances of the
many vague and absurd conjectures which have been propounded respecting
the designer or the engraver of the cuts in the Lyons editions of the
Dance of Death. In a copy of this work of the edition 1545 now in the
British Museum, but formerly belonging to the Reverend C.&nbsp;M.
Cracherode, a&nbsp;portrait of a painter or engraver named Hans
Ladenspelder is inserted opposite to the cut of the Duchess, as if in
support of the conjecture that <i>he</i> might be the designer of those
cuts, merely from the circumstance of the initial letters of his name
corresponding with the mark <img class = "middle" src =
"images/illus_342b.png" width = "29" height = "21" alt = "HL">. The
portrait is a small oval engraved on copper, with an ornamental border,
round which is the following inscription: “Imago Joannis Ladenspelder,
Essendiensis, Anno ætatis suæ xxviii. 1540.”<a class = "tag" name =
"tagVI29" id = "tagVI29" href = "#noteVI29">VI.29</a> The mark <img
class = "middle" src = "images/illus_355a.png" width = "20" height =
"17" alt = "L"> is perceived on this portrait, and underneath is written
the following MS. note, referring to the mark in the cut of the Duchess:
“<img class = "middle" src = "images/illus_342b.png" width = "29" height
= "21" alt = "HL"> the mark of the designer of these designs of Death’s
Dance, not H.&nbsp;Holbein. By several persons that have seen Holbein’s
Death Dance at Basil, it is not like these, nor in the same manner.”
This note, so far as relates to the implied conjecture about
Ladenspelder, may be allowed to pass without remark for what it is
worth; but it seems necessary to remind the reader that the painting of
the Dance of Death at Basle, here evidently alluded to, <i>was not</i>
the work of Holbein, and to observe that this note is not in the
handwriting of Mr. Cracherode, but that it has apparently been written
by a former owner of the volume.</p>

<p>In a copy of the first edition, now lying before me, a former owner
has written on the fly-leaf the following verses from page 158 of the
Nugæ&mdash;Lyons, 1540,&mdash;of Nicholas Borbonius, a&nbsp;French
poet:</p>

<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page356" id = "page356">
356</a></span>
<div class = "verse">
<p class = "open">“Videre qui vult Parrhasium cum Zeuxide,</p>
<p class = "indent">Accersat a Britannia</p>
<p>Hansum Ulbium, et Georgium Reperdium</p>
<p class = "indent">Lugduno ab urbe Galliæ.”</p>
</div>

<p>The meaning of these verses may be thus expressed in English:</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>Whoever wishes to behold,</p>
<p>Painters like to those of old,</p>
<p>To England straightway let him <ins class = "correction" title = "‘n’ invisible">send</ins>,</p>
<p>And summon Holbein to attend;</p>
<p>Reperdius,<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI30" id = "tagVI30" href =
"#noteVI30">VI.30</a> too, from Lyons bring,</p>
<p>A city of the Gallic King.</p>
</div>

<p>To the extract from Borbonius,&mdash;or Bourbon, as he is more
frequently called, without the Latin termination,&mdash;the writer has
added a note: “<i>An Reperdius harum Iconum sculptor fuerit?</i>” That
is: “Query, if Reperdius were the engraver of these cuts?”&mdash;meaning
the cuts contained in the Lyons Dance of Death. Mr. Douce also cites the
preceding verses from Nicholas Bourbon; and upon so slight and unstable
a foundation he, <i>more solito</i>, raises a ponderous superstructure.
He, in fact, says, that “it is <i>extremely probable</i> that he might
have begun the work in question [the designs for the Dance of Death],
and have died before he could complete it, and that the Lyons publishers
might have afterwards employed Holbein to finish what was left undone,
as well as to make designs for additional subjects which appeared in the
subsequent editions. Thus would Holbein be so connected with the work as
to obtain in future such notice as would constitute him by general
report the real inventor of it.”</p>

<p>Perhaps in the whole of the discussion on this subject a more
tortuous piece of argument is not to be found. It strikingly exemplifies
<ins class = "correction" title = ". missing">Mr.</ins> Douce’s
eagerness to avail himself of the most trifling circumstance which
seemed to favour his own views; and his manner of twisting and twining
it is sufficient to excite a suspicion even in the mind of the most
careless inquirer, that the chain of argument which consists of a series
of such links must be little better than a rope of sand. Mr. Douce must
have had singular notions of probability, when, upon the mere mention of
the name of Reperdius, by Bourbon, as a painter then residing at Lyons,
he asserts that it is <i>extremely probable</i> that he, Reperdius,
might have begun the work: it is evident that he does not employ the
term in its usual and proper sense. If for “<i>extremely probable</i>”
the words “<i>barely possible</i>” be substituted, the passage will be
unobjectionable; and will then fairly represent the value of the
conjecture of Reperdius having designed any of the cuts in question. If
it be <i>extremely probable</i>
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page357" id = "page357">
357</a></span>
that the cuts of the first edition of the Lyons Dance of Death were
designed by Reperdius, from the mere occurrence of his name in Bourbon,
the evidence in favour of their being designed by Holbein ought with
equal reason to be considered as <i>plusquam-perfect</i>; for the voices
of his contemporaries are expressly in his favour, the cuts themselves
bear a strong general resemblance to those which are known to be of his
designing, and some of the figures and details in the cuts of the Dance
of Death correspond so nearly with others in the Bible-cuts designed by
Holbein, and also printed at Lyons by the brothers Trechsel, and in the
same year, that there cannot be a doubt in the mind of any impartial
inquirer who shall compare them, that either both series must have been
designed by the same person, or that Holbein had servilely copied the
works of an unknown artist greater than himself. Upon one of the horns
of this dilemma, Mr. Douce, and all who assert that the cuts of the
Lyons Dance of Death <i>were not designed by Holbein</i>, must
inevitably be fixed.</p>

<p>One of the earliest evidences in favour of Holbein being the designer
of the cuts in the Lyons Dance of Death is Nicholas Bourbon, the author
of the epigram previously cited. In an edition of his Nugæ, published at
Basle in 1540, are the following verses:<a class = "tag" name =
"tagVI31" id = "tagVI31" href = "#noteVI31">VI.31</a></p>

<div class = "verse w25">
<h5><i>De morte picta à Hanso pictore nobili.</i></h5>

<p>Dum mortis Hansus pictor imaginem exprimit,</p>
<p>Tanta arte mortem retulit ut mors vivere</p>
<p>Videatur ipsa: et ipse se immortalibus</p>
<p>Parem Diis fecerit operis hujus gloria.</p>
</div>

<p>Now,&mdash;after premising that the term <i>picta</i> was applied to
designs engraved on wood, as well as to paintings in oil or
water-colours,<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI32" id = "tagVI32" href =
"#noteVI32">VI.32</a>&mdash;it may be asked to what work of Holbein’s do
these lines refer? The painting in the church-court at Basle was not
executed by Holbein; neither was it ascribed to him by his
contemporaries; for the popular error which assigns it to him appears to
have originated with certain travellers who visited Basle upwards of a
hundred years after Holbein’s decease. It indeed may be answered that
Bourbon might allude to the <i>alphabet</i> of the Dance of Death which
has been ascribed to Holbein. A&nbsp;mere supposition of this kind,
however, would be untenable in this instance; for there is no direct
evidence to show that Holbein was the designer of this alphabet, and the
principal reason for supposing it to
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page358" id = "page358">
358</a></span>
have been designed by him rests upon the previous assumption of his
being the designer of the cuts of the Lyons Dance of Death. Deny him the
honour of this work, and assert that the last quoted verses of Bourbon
must relate to some other, and the difficulty of showing by anything
like credible evidence, that he was the designer of any other series of
cuts, or even of a single cut, or painting, of the same subject, becomes
increased tenfold. Mr. Douce, with the gross inconsistency that
distinguishes the whole of his arguments on this subject, ascribes the
alphabet of the Dance of Peasants to Holbein, and yet cautiously avoids
mentioning him as the designer of the alphabet of the Dance of Death,
though the reasons for this conclusion are precisely the same as those
on which he rests the former assertion. Nay, so confused and
contradictory are his opinions on this point, that in another part of
his book he actually describes both alphabets as being the work of the
same designer and the same engraver.</p>

<p>“Some of the writers on engraving,” says Mr. Douce, “have manifested
their usual inaccuracy on the subject of Holbein’s Dance of
Peasants.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. There is, however,
<i>no doubt</i> that his beautiful pencil was employed on this subject
in various ways, of which the following specimens are worthy of being
recorded. In a set of initial letters frequently used in books printed
at Basle and elsewhere,” &amp;c.&nbsp;After thus having unhesitatingly
ascribed the Dance of Peasants to Holbein, Mr. Douce, in a subsequent
page,&mdash;when giving a list of cuts which he ascribes to Hans
Lutzelburger,&mdash;writes as follows: “8. An alphabet with a Dance of
Death, the subjects of which, with a few exceptions, are the same as
those in the other Dance; the designs, however, occasionally vary,”
&amp;c.&nbsp;On concluding his description of this alphabet, he thus
notices the alphabet of the Dance of Peasants, having apparently forgot
that he had previously ascribed the latter to Holbein. “9. Another
alphabet <i>by the same artists</i>. It is a Dance of Peasants,
intermixed with other subjects, some of which are not of the most
delicate nature.”<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI33" id = "tagVI33" href =
"#noteVI33">VI.33</a></p>

<p>It is, however, uncertain if Mr. Douce really did believe Holbein to
be the designer of the alphabet of the Dance of Death, though from the
preceding extracts it is plainly, though indirectly asserted, that he
<i>was</i>. In his wish to claim the engraving of the Dance of Peasants
for Lutzelburger, Mr. Douce does not seem to have been aware that from
the words “by the same artists,” coupled with his previous assertion, of
Holbein being the designer of that alphabet, it followed as a direct
consequence that he was also the designer of the alphabet of the Dance
of Death. Putting this charitable construction on Mr. Douce’s words, it
follows that <i>his</i> assertion of Lutzelburger being the engraver of
the Dance of Peasants is purely gratuitous. If Mr. Douce really believed
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page359" id = "page359">
359</a></span>
that Holbein was the designer of the alphabet of the Dance of Death, he
ought in fairness to have expressly declared his opinion; although such
declaration would have caused his arguments, against Holbein being the
designer of the cuts in the Lyons Dance of Death, to appear more
paradoxical and absurd than they are when unconnected with such an
opinion; for what person, with the slightest pretensions to rationality,
could assert that Holbein was the designer of the alphabet of the Dance
of Death executed in 1530, the subjects, with few exceptions, the same
as those in the Dance of Death published at Lyons in 1538, and yet in
direct opposition to contemporary testimony, and the internal evidence
of the subjects themselves, deny that he was the designer of the cuts in
the latter work, on the sole authority of the nameless writer of a
preface which only appeared in the first edition of the book, and which,
there seems reason to suspect, was addressed to an imaginary personage?
Was Madame Jehanne de Touszele likely to feel herself highly
complimented by having dedicated to her a work which contains undeniable
evidences of the artist’s having been no friend to popery? In one cut a
couple of fiends appear to be ridiculing his “Holiness” the pope; and in
another is a young gallant with a guitar, entertaining a nun in her
bed-chamber. If a pious abbess of St. Peter’s, Lyons, in 1538, should
have considered that such cuts “tended to edification,” she must have
been an extremely liberal woman for her age. It is exceedingly amusing,
in looking over the cuts of the Lyons Dance of Death, to contrast the
drollery and satire of the designer with the endeavours of the textuary
and versifier to give them a devout and spiritual turn.</p>

<p>As it is certain from the verses of Bourbon, in praise of Holbein as
the painter or designer of a subject, or a series of subjects,
representing “Death as if he were alive,”&mdash;ut mors vivere
videatur,&mdash;that this celebrated artist <i>had designed</i> a Dance
of Death, Mr. Douce, being unable to deny the evidence thus afforded,
paradoxically proceeds to fit those verses to his own theory; and after
quoting them, at page 139, proceeds as follows: “It has already been
demonstrated that these lines could not refer to the old painting of the
Macaber Dance at the Dominican convent, whilst from the important
dedication to the edition of the wood-cuts first published at Lyons in
1538, it is next to impossible that that work could then have been in
Borbonius’s contemplation. It appears from several places in his Nugæ
that he was in England in 1535, at which time Holbein drew his portrait
in such a manner as to excite his gratitude and admiration in another
copy of verses .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He returned to Lyons
in 1536, and it is known that he was there in 1538, when he probably
wrote the complimentary lines in Holbein’s Biblical designs a short time
before their publication, either out of friendship to the painter, or at
the instance of the Lyons publisher, with whom he was
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page360" id = "page360">
360</a></span>
certainly connected.&mdash;Now, if Borbonius, during his residence at
Lyons, had been assured that the designs in the wood-cuts of the Dance
of Death were the production of Holbein, would not his before-mentioned
lines on that subject have been likewise introduced into the Lyons
edition of it, or at least into some subsequent editions, in none of
which is any mention whatever made of Holbein, although the work was
continued even after the death of that artist? The application,
therefore, of Borbonius’s lines must be sought for elsewhere; but it is
greatly to be regretted that he has not adverted to the place where the
painting,<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI34" id = "tagVI34" href =
"#noteVI34">VI.34</a> as he seems to call it, was made.”</p>

<p>Mr. Douce next proceeds in his search after the “painting,” and he is
not long in finding what he wishes for. According to his statement,
“<i>very soon after</i> the calamitous fire at Whitehall, 1697, which
consumed nearly the whole of that palace, a&nbsp;person, calling himself
T.&nbsp;Nieuhoff Piccard, probably belonging to the household of William
III, and a man who appears to have been an amateur artist,” made
etchings after nineteen of the cuts in the Lyons Dance of Death.
Impressions of those etchings, accompanied with manuscript dedications,
appear to have been presented by this T.&nbsp;Nieuhoff Piccard to his
friends or patrons, and among others to a Mynheer Heymans, and to “the
high, noble, and well-born Lord William Denting, Lord of Rhoon,
Pendraght,” &amp;c.&nbsp;The address to Mynheer Heymans contains the
following important piece of information respecting a work of Holbein’s,
which appears most singularly to have escaped the notice of every other
writer, whether English or foreign. “Sir,&mdash;The costly palace of
Whitehall, erected by Cardinal Wolsey, and the residence of King Henry
VIII, contains, among other performances of art, a&nbsp;Dance of Death,
<i>painted by Holbein</i>, in its galleries, which, through an
unfortunate conflagration, has been reduced to ashes.”<a class = "tag"
name = "tagVI35" id = "tagVI35" href = "#noteVI35">VI.35</a> In the
dedication to the “high, noble, and well-born Lord William Benting,” the
information respecting this curious work of art,&mdash;all memory of
which would have perished had it not been for the said T.&nbsp;Nieuhoff
Piccard,&mdash;is rather more precise. “Sir, [not My Lord,]&mdash;In the
course of my constant love and pursuit of works of art, it has been my
good fortune to meet with that scarce little work of Hans Holbein,
neatly engraved on wood, and which he himself had <i>painted as large as
life</i>, in fresco, on the walls of Whitehall.” Who Mynheer Heymans was
will probably never be discovered, but he seems to have been a person of
some consequence in his day, though unfortunately never mentioned in any
history or memoirs of the period, for it appears that the court thought
proper, in consideration of his singular deserts, to
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page361" id = "page361">
361</a></span>
cause a dwelling to be built for him at Whitehall. My Lord William
Benting,<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI36" id = "tagVI36" href =
"#noteVI36">VI.36</a>&mdash;though from his name and titles he might be
mistaken for a member of the Bentinck family,&mdash;appears to have been
actually born in the palace. It is, however, very unfortunate that his
name does not occur in the peerage of that time; and as neither Rhoon
nor Pendraght are to be found in Flanders or Holland, it is not unlikely
that these may be the names of two of his lordship’s <i>castles in
Spain</i>.</p>

<p>T. Nieuhoff Piccard’s express testimony of Holbein having painted a
Dance of Death in fresco, at Whitehall, is, in Mr. Douce’s opinion,
further corroborated by the following circumstances: 1.&nbsp;“In one of
Vanderdort’s manuscript catalogues of the pictures and rarities
transported from St. James’s to Whitehall, and placed there in the newly
erected cabinet room of Charles I, and in which several works by Holbein
are mentioned, there is the following article: ‘A&nbsp;little piece,
where Death with a green garland about his head, stretching both his
arms to apprehend a Pilate in the habit of one of the spiritual
Prince-Electors of Germany. Copied by Isaac Oliver from Holbein.’ There
cannot be a doubt that this refers to the subject of the Elector as
painted by Holbein in the Dance of Death at Whitehall, proving at the
same time the identity of the painting with the wood-cuts, whatever may
be the inference. 2.&nbsp;Sandrart, after noticing a remarkable portrait
of Henry VIII. at Whitehall, states ‘that there yet remains at that
palace <i>another work</i>, by Holbein, that constitutes him the Apelles
of his time.’ This is certainly <i>very like an allusion</i> to a Dance
of Death. 3.&nbsp;It is <i>by no means improbable</i> that Matthew Prior
may have alluded to Holbein’s painting at Whitehall, as it is not likely
that he would be acquainted with any other.</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>‘Our term of life depends not on our deed,</p>
<p>Before our birth our funeral was decreed;</p>
<p>Nor aw’d by foresight, nor misled by chance,</p>

<p>Peoples great Henry’s tombs, and leads up Holbein’s Dance.’</p>

<p class = "author">
<i>Prior, Ode to the Memory of George Villiers.</i>”<a class = "tag"
name = "tagVI37" id = "tagVI37" href = "#noteVI37">VI.37</a></p>
</div>

<p>Mr. Douce having previously <i>proved</i> that Holbein was <i>not</i>
the designer of the cuts in the Lyons Dance of Death, thus, in a manner
<i>equally
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page362" id = "page362">
362</a></span>
satisfactory</i>, accounts for the verses of Bourbon, by showing, on the
<i>unexceptionable</i> evidence of “a&nbsp;person, calling himself
T.&nbsp;Nieuhoff Piccard, <i>probably</i> belonging to the household of
William III,” that the great work of Holbein&mdash;by the fame of which
he had made himself equal with the immortal gods&mdash;was painted as
large as life, in fresco, on the walls of Whitehall. The ingenuity
displayed in depriving Holbein of the honour of the Lyons cuts is no
less exemplified in proving him to be the painter of a similar subject
in Whitehall. The key-stone is worthy of the arch.</p>

<p>Though the <i>facts</i> and <i>arguments</i> put forth by Mr. Douce,
in proof of Holbein having painted a Dance of Death on the walls of the
old palace of Whitehall, and of this having been the identical Dance of
Death alluded to by Bourbon, might be summarily dismissed as being of
that kind which no objection could render more absurd, yet it seems
necessary to direct the especial attention of the reader to one or two
points; and first to the assertion that “it is next to impossible that
the Lyons Dance of Death of 1538 could then have been in Borbonius’s
contemplation.” Now, in direct opposition to what is here said, it
appears to me highly probable that <i>this</i> was the very work on
account of which he addressed his epigram to Holbein; and it is moreover
evident that Bourbon expresses in Latin verse almost precisely the same
ideas as those which had previously been expressed in French by the
writer of the address to Madame Jehanne de Touszele, when speaking of
the merits of the nameless artist who is there alluded to as the
designer or engraver of the cuts.<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI38" id =
"tagVI38" href = "#noteVI38">VI.38</a> As Holbein is not certainly known
to be the painter or designer of any other Dance of Death which might
merit the high praise conveyed in Bourbon’s verses, to what other work
of his will they apply? Even supposing, as I do, that the alphabet of
the Dance of Death was designed by Holbein, I&nbsp;conceive it “next to
impossible,” to use the words of Mr. Douce, that Bourbon should have
described Holbein as having attained immortality through the fame of
those twenty-four small letters, a&nbsp;perfect set of which I believe
is not to be found in any single volume.
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page363" id = "page363">
363</a></span>
That Bourbon <i>did</i> know who was the designer of the cuts of the
Lyons Dance of Death there can scarcely be the shadow of a doubt; he was
at Lyons in the year in which the work was published; he was connected
with the printers; and another work, the Icones Historiarum Veteris
Testamenti, also published by them in 1538, has at the commencement a
copy of verses written by Bourbon, from which alone we learn that
Holbein was the designer of the cuts,&mdash;the first four of which
cuts, be it observed, being from the same blocks as the first four in
the Dance of Death, published by the same printers, in the same year.
What might be the motives of the printers for not inserting Bourbon’s
epigram in praise of Holbein in the subsequent editions of the Dance of
Death, supposing him to be the designer of the cuts, I&nbsp;cannot tell,
nor will I venture to <i>guess</i>. They certainly must have had some
reason for concealing the designer’s name, for the writer of the
prefatory address to Madame Jehanne de Touszele takes care not to
mention it even when speaking in so laudatory a style of the excellence
of the designs. Among the other unaccountable things connected with this
work, I&nbsp;may mention the fact of the French prefatory address to the
abbess of St. Peter’s appearing only in the first, and being omitted in
every subsequent edition.</p>

<p>With respect to T. Nieuhoff Piccard, whose manuscript addresses to
“Mynheer Heymans” and “Lord William Benting” are cited to <i>prove</i>
that Bourbon’s verses must relate to a painting of the Dance of Death by
Holbein in the old palace of Whitehall, nothing whatever is known; and
there is not the slightest reason to believe that a Lord William
Benting, born in the old palace of Whitehall, “Lord of Rhoon,
Pendraght,” &amp;c.&nbsp;ever existed. I&nbsp;am of opinion that the
addresses of the person calling himself T.&nbsp;Nieuhoff Piccard are a
clumsy attempt at imposition.<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI39" id =
"tagVI39" href = "#noteVI39">VI.39</a> Though Mr. Douce had seen both
those addresses, and also another of the same kind, he does not appear
to have made any attempt to trace their former owners, nor does he
mention the names of the parties in whose possession they were at the
time that he saw them. He had seen the address to “Lord William Benting”
previous to the publication of his
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page364" id = "page364">
364</a></span>
observations on the Dance of Death in 1794, when, if he had felt
inclined, he might have ascertained from whom the then possessor had
received it, and thus obtained a clue to guide him in his inquiries
respecting the personal identity of the Lord of Rhoon and Pendraght. But
this would not have suited his purpose; for he seems to have been
conscious that any inquiry respecting such a person would only have
tended to confirm the doubts respecting the paper addressed to him by
Piccard. It is also uncertain at what time those pretended addresses
were written, but there are impressions of the etchings which
accompanied them with the date 1720; and I am inclined to think that if
the paper and handwriting were closely examined, it would be found that
those pretended presentation addresses were manufactured about the same,
or perhaps at a later period. Whoever the person calling himself
T.&nbsp;Nieuhoff Piccard may have been, or at whatever time the
addresses to Mynheer Heymans and others may have been written, the only
evidence of there having been a painting of the Dance by Holbein at
Whitehall rests on his unsupported statement. Such a painting is not
mentioned by any foreign traveller who had visited this country, nor is
it noticed by any English writer prior to 1697; it is not alluded to in
any tragedy, comedy, farce, or masque, in which we might expect that
such a painting would have been incidentally mentioned had it ever
existed. Evelyn, who must have frequently been in the old palace of
Whitehall, says not a word of such a painting, though he mentions the
Lyons Dance of Death under the title of Mortis Imago, and ascribes the
cuts to Holbein;<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI40" id = "tagVI40" href =

in Vertue or Walpole.</p>

<p>The learned Conrad Gesner, who was born at Zurich in 1516, and died
there in 1565, expressly ascribes the Lyons Dance of Death to Holbein;<a
class = "tag" name = "tagVI41" id = "tagVI41" href =
"#noteVI41">VI.41</a> and, notwithstanding the contradictory statement
in the preface to the
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page365" id = "page365">
365</a></span>
first edition of this work, such appears to have been the general belief
of all the artist’s contemporaries. Van Mander, who was born in 1548,
and who died in 1606, appears to have been the first person who gave any
account of the life of Holbein. His work, entitled Het Schilder Boek,
consisting of biographical notices of painters, chiefly Germans and
Flemings, was first published in 1604; and, when speaking of Holbein, he
mentions the Lyons Dance of Death among his other works. Sandrart, in
common with every other writer on art of the period, also ascribes the
Lyons work to Holbein, and he gives the following account of a
conversation that he had with Rubens respecting those cuts:
“I&nbsp;remember that in the year 1627, when the celebrated Rubens was
proceeding to Utrecht to visit Honthorst, I&nbsp;accompanied him as far
as Amsterdam; and during our passage in the boat I looked into Holbein’s
little book of the Dance of Death, the cuts of which Rubens highly
praised, recommending me, as I was a young man, to copy them, observing,
that he had copied them himself in his youth.” Sandrart, who seems to
have been one of the earliest writers who supposed that Durer, Cranach,
and others engraved their own designs, without any just grounds
describes Holbein as a wood engraver. Patin, in his edition of the
“Stultitiæ Laus” of Erasmus, 1676, repeats the same story; and Papillon
in his decisive manner clenches it by asserting that “most of the
delicate wood-cuts and ornamental letters which are to be found in books
printed at Basle, Zurich, and towns in Switzerland, at Lyons, London,
&amp;c.&nbsp;from 1520 to about 1540, were engraved by Holbein himself.”
Papillon also says that it is believed&mdash;<i>on croit</i>&mdash;that
Holbein began to engrave in 1511, when he was about sixteen. “What is
extraordinary in this painter,” he further adds, “is, that he painted
and engraved with the left hand, so that he consequently engraved the
lines on the wood from right to left, instead of, as with us, engraving
from left to right.”<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI42" id = "tagVI42"
href = "#noteVI42">VI.42</a> Jansen, and a host of other compilers,
without inquiry, repeat the story of Holbein having been a wood
engraver, and that the cuts of the Lyons Dance of Death were engraved by
himself. That he was the designer of those cuts I am thoroughly
convinced, though I consider it “next to impossible” that he should have
been also the engraver.</p>

<p>Holbein’s Bible Cuts, as they are usually called, were first
published at Lyons, in 1538, the same year, and by the same printers, as
the Dance of Death. The book is a small quarto, and the title is as
follows: “Historiarum Veteris Testamenti Icones ad vivum expressæ. Una
cum brevi, sed quoad fieri potuit, dilucida earundem et Latina et
Gallica
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page366" id = "page366">
366</a></span>
expositione. Lugduni sub scuto Coloniensi. <span class =
"smallroman">M.D.XXXVIII.</span>”<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI43" id =
"tagVI43" href = "#noteVI43">VI.43</a> On the title-page is an
emblematic cut, with the motto <i>Usus me genuit</i>, similar to that on
the title-page in the first edition of the Dance of Death, but not
precisely the same; and at the end is the imprint of the brothers
Melchior and Caspar Trechsel within an ornamental border, as in the
latter work. I&nbsp;am greatly inclined to think that the brothers were
only the printers of the first editions of the Dance of Death and the
Bible cuts, and that the real proprietors were John and Francis Frellon,
whose names appear as the publishers in subsequent editions.</p>

<p>This opinion seems to be corroborated by the fact of there being an
address from “<i>Franciscus Frellaeus</i>” to the Christian Reader in
the Bible cuts of 1538 and 1539, which in subsequent editions is altered
to “Franciscus <i>Frellonius</i>.” That the same person is designated by
those names, I&nbsp;think there can be little doubt, as the addresses
are literally the same. From adopting the form “Frellaeus,” however, in
the editions of 1538 and 1539, it would seem that the writer was not
wishful to discover his name. When the work becomes popular he writes it
Frellonius; and in the second edition of the Dance of Death, when the
character of this work is also established, and there seems no longer
reason to apprehend the censures of the church of Rome, we find the
names of John and Francis Frellon on the title-page under the “shield of
Cologne.” Whatever might be their motives, it seems certain that the
first publishers of the Dance of Death were wishful to withhold their
names; and it is likely that the designer of the cuts might have equally
good reasons for concealment. Had the Roman Catholic party considered
the cuts of the Pope, the Nun, and two or three others as the covert
satire of a <i>reformed</i> painter, the publishers and the designer
would have been as likely to incur danger as to reap profit or fame.</p>

<p>The address of Franciscus Frellaeus is followed by a copy of Latin
verses by Nicholas Bourbon, in which Holbein is mentioned as the
designer; and immediately preceding the cuts is an address “aux
lecteurs,” in French verse, by Gilles Corrozet, who, perhaps, might be
the poet that supplied the French expositions of those cuts, and the
“descriptions severement rithmées” of the Dance of Death. The following
is an extract from Bourbon’s prefatory verses, the whole of which it
appears unnecessary to give.</p>

<p>When <ins class = "correction" title = ". missing">Mr.</ins> Douce
stated that it was “<i>extremely probable</i> that the anonymous painter
or designer of the Dance might have been employed also by the Frellons
to execute a set of subjects for the Bible previously to his death, and
that Holbein was afterwards employed to complete the work,” he seems to
have forgot that such a testimony of Holbein being the designer was
prefixed to the Bible cuts. In answer to Mr. Douce it may be asked, in
his own style, if the Frellons knew that another artist was the designer
of the cuts of the Dance of Death, and if he also had been originally
employed to design the Bible cuts, how does it happen that they should
allow Bourbon to give all the honour of the latter to Holbein, who, if
the Dance of Death be not his, was certainly much inferior as a designer
to the nameless artist whose unfinished work he was employed to
complete?</p>

<p>The total number of the Bible cuts in the first edition of the work
is ninety, the first four of which are the same as the first four of the
Dance of Death; the other eighty-six are of a different form to the
first four, as will be perceived from the specimens, which are of the
same size as the originals. Those eighty-six cuts are generally much
inferior in design to those of the Dance of Death, and the style in
which they are engraved is very unequal, some of them being executed
with considerable
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page368" id = "page368">
368</a></span>
neatness and delicacy, and others in a much coarser manner. The
following cut, Abraham about to sacrifice Isaac, Genesis <span class =
"smallroman">XXII</span>, is one of those which are the best engraved;
but even these, so far as regards the expression of the features and the
delicate marking of the hands, are generally much inferior to the cuts
of the Dance of Death.</p>

<p class = "illustration">
<a name = "illus_368" id = "illus_368">&nbsp;</a>
<img src = "images/illus_368.png" width = "333" height = "207"
alt = "see text"></p>

<p>Though most of the Bible cuts are inferior both in design and
execution to those of the Dance of Death, and though several of them are
rudely drawn and badly engraved, yet many of them afford points of such
perfect identity with those of the Dance of Death, that it seems
impossible to come to any other conclusion than that either the cuts of
both works have been designed by the same person, or that the designer
of the one series has servilely copied from the designer of the other,
and, what is most singular, in many trifling details which seem the
least likely to be imitated, and which usually constitute individual
peculiarities of style. For instance, the small shrubby tree in the
preceding cut is precisely of the same species as that seen in the cut
of the Old Woman in the Dance of Death; and the angel about to stay
Abraham’s hand bears a strong general resemblance to the angel in Adam
and Eve driven out of Paradise.</p>

<p>The cut on the opposite page&mdash;the Fool, Psalm <span class =
"smallroman">LIII</span>&mdash;is copied from one of those executed in a
coarser style than the preceding. The children in this cut are evidently
of the same family as those of the Dance of Death.</p>

<p>In the first cut, the Creation, a crack is perceived running nearly
down the middle from top to bottom, in the edition of the Dance of Death
of 1545. It is also perceptible in all the subsequent Lyons editions of
this work and of the Bible cuts. It is, however, less obvious in the
Bible cuts of the edition 1549 than in some of the preceding,
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page369" id = "page369">
369</a></span>
probably in consequence of the block having been cramped to remedy the
defect. Mr. Douce speaks, at page 105, as if the crack were not
discernible in the Bible cuts of 1549; it is, however, quite perceptible
in every copy that has come under my notice. Some of the latter editions
of this work contain four additional cuts, which are all coarsely
executed. In the edition of 1547 they form the illustrations to
Ezekiel&nbsp;<span class = "smallroman">XL</span>; Ezekiel <span class =
"smallroman">XLIII</span>; Jonah <span class = "smallroman">I</span>,
<span class = "smallroman">II</span>, and <span class =
"smallroman">III</span>; and Habakkuk. The Bible cuts were also printed
with explanations in English. The title of a copy now before me is as
follows: “The Images of the Old Testament, lately expressed, set forthe
in Ynglishe and Frenche vuith a playn and brief exposition. Printed at
Lyons by Johan Frellon, the yere of our Lord God, 1549,” 4to. In the
latter editions there are wood-cuts of the four Evangelists, each within
an oval border, on the last leaf. They bear no tokens of Holbein’s
style.</p>

<img src = "images/illus_369.png" width = "334" height = "235"

<p>Among the many instances of resemblance which are to be perceived on
comparing the Dance of Death with the Bible cuts, the following may be
enumerated as the most remarkable. The peculiar manner in which fire
with smoke, and the waves of the sea, are represented in the Dance of
Death can scarcely fail to strike the most heedless observer; for
instance, the fire in the cut of Death seizing the child, and the waves
in the cut of the Seaman. In the Bible cuts we perceive the same
peculiarity; there is the same kind of fire in Moses directing the
manner of burnt offerings, Leviticus&nbsp;<span class =
"smallroman">I</span>; in the burning of Nadab and Abihu,
Leviticus&nbsp;<span class = "smallroman">X</span>; and in every other
one of those cuts where fire is seen. In the destruction of Pharaoh and
his host, Exodus <span class = "smallroman">XIV</span>, are the same
kind of curling waves. Except in the Dance of Death and the Bible cuts,
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page370" id = "page370">
370</a></span>
I&nbsp;have never seen an instance of fire or water represented in such
a manner. If those cuts were designed by two different artists, it is
certainly singular that in this respect they should display so perfect a
coincidence of idea. The sheep in the cut of the Bishop in the Dance of
Death are the same as those in the Bible cut of Moses seeing God in the
burning bush, Exodus <span class = "smallroman">III</span>; and the
female figure in the cut of the Elector in the former work is perceived
in the Bible cut of the captive Midianites, Numbers <span class =
"smallroman">XXXI</span>. The children introduced in both works are
almost perfectly identical, as will be perceived on comparing the cut of
Little Children mocking Elijah, chapter&nbsp;<span class =
"smallroman">II</span>, Kings&nbsp;<span class = "smallroman">II</span>,
with those of the Elector, and Death seizing the child, in the Dance of
Death. The face of the Duchess in the latter work is the same as that of
Esther in the Bible cut, Esther, chapter&nbsp;<span class =
"smallroman">II</span>; and in this cut ornaments on the tapestry, like
fleurs-de-lis, behind the throne of Ahasuerus, are the same as those on
the tapestry behind the King in the Dance of Death. The latter
coincidence has been noticed by Mr. Douce, who, in direct opposition to
the evidence of the German or Swiss costume of the living characters of
the Dance of Death, considers it as contributing to demonstrate that
both the series of those cuts are of Gallic origin.<a class = "tag" name
= "tagVI44" id = "tagVI44" href = "#noteVI44">VI.44</a> It is needless
to enumerate more instances of almost complete identity of figures and
details in the cuts of the Dance of Death and those of the Bible
illustrations; they are too frequent to have originated from a
conventional mode of representing certain objects and persons; and they
are most striking in minor details, where one artist would be least
likely to imitate another, but where the same individual designer would
be most likely to repeat himself. “As to the designs of these truly
elegant prints,” says Mr. Douce, speaking of the cuts of the Dance of
Death, “no one who is at all skilled in the knowledge of Holbein’s style
and manner of grouping his figures would hesitate immediately to ascribe
them to that artist.”<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI45" id = "tagVI45"
href = "#noteVI45">VI.45</a> As this opinion is corroborated by a
comparison of the Dance of Death with the Bible cuts, and as the
internal evidence of the cuts of the
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page371" id = "page371">
371</a></span>
Dance of Death in favour of Holbein is confirmed by the testimony of his
contemporaries, the reader can decide for himself how far Holbein’s
positive claims to the honour of this work ought to be affected by the
passage in the anonymous address to Madame Jehanne de Touszele, which
forms the groundwork of Mr. Douce’s theory.</p>

<p>Having now examined the principal arguments which have been alleged
to show that Holbein <i>was not</i> the designer of the Dance of Death,
and having endeavoured to justify his claims to that honour by producing
the evidences on which they rest, I&nbsp;shall now take leave of this
subject, feeling thoroughly assured that <span class =
"smallcaps">Holbein was the designer of the cuts of the first edition of
the Lyons Dance of Death</span>; and trusting, though with no
overweening confidence, that the preceding investigation will render it
necessary for the next questioner of his title to produce stronger
objections than the solitary ambiguous passage in the preface to the
first edition of the work, and to support them with more forcible and
consistent arguments than have been put forth by Mr. Douce. M.&nbsp;T.
Nieuhoff Piccard, I&nbsp;am inclined to think, will never again be
called as a witness in this cause; and before the passage in the preface
can be allowed to have any weight, it must be shown that such a
personage as Madame Jehanne de Touszele <i>was</i> prioress of the
convent of St. Peter at Lyons at the time of the first publication of
the work: and even should such a fact be established, the ambiguity of
the passage&mdash;whether the pretendedly deceased artist were the
engraver or designer, or both,&mdash;and the obvious desire to conceal
his name, remain to be explained.</p>

<p>In 1538, the year in which the Dance of Death and the Bible cuts were
first published at Lyons, Holbein was residing in England under the
patronage of Henry VIII; though it is also certain that about the
beginning of September in that year he returned to Basle and he remained
there a few weeks.<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI46" id = "tagVI46" href
= "#noteVI46">VI.46</a></p>

<p>As the productions of this distinguished painter occupy so large a
portion of this chapter, it perhaps may not be unnecessary to give here
a few particulars of his life, chiefly derived from Hegner’s work,
previous to his coming to England. Hans Holbein, the Younger, as he is
often called by German writers to distinguish him from his father, was
the son of Hans Holbein, a&nbsp;painter of considerable reputation. The
year and place of his birth have not been positively ascertained, but
there seems reason to believe that he was born in 1498, at Augsburg,<a
class = "tag" name = "tagVI47" id = "tagVI47" href =
"#noteVI47">VI.47</a>
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page372" id = "page372">
372</a></span>
of which city his father was a burgher, and from whence he appears to
have removed with his family to Basle, about the end of the fifteenth or
the beginning of the sixteenth century. Young Holbein was brought up to
his father’s profession, and at an early age displayed the germ of his
future excellence. There is a portrait in oil by young Holbein of the
date of 1513, which, according to Hegner, though rather weak in colour
and somewhat hard in outline, is yet clearly and delicately painted.
From the excellence of his early productions, Patin, in his Life of
Holbein, prefixed to an edition of the Laus Stultitiæ of Erasmus<a class
= "tag" name = "tagVI48" id = "tagVI48" href = "#noteVI48">VI.48</a>
thinks that he must have been born in 1495. That he was born in 1498
there can, however, be little doubt, for Hegner mentions a portrait of
him, at Basle, when in the forty-fifth year of his age, with the date
1543. Several anecdotes are told of Holbein as a jolly fellow, and of
his twice or thrice discharging his account at a tavern by painting a
Dance of Peasants. Though there seems reason to believe that Holbein was
a free liver, and that he did paint such a subject in a house at Basle,
the stories of his thus settling for his liquor are highly improbable.
He appears to have married young, for in a painting of his wife and two
children, executed before he left Basle for England in 1526, the eldest
child, a&nbsp;boy, appears to be between four and five years old.<a
class = "tag" name = "tagVI49" id = "tagVI49" href =
"#noteVI49">VI.49</a></p>

<p>The name of Holbein’s wife is unknown; but it is said that, like
Durer’s, she was of an unhappy temper, and that he enjoyed no peace with
her. It is not, however, unlikely that his own unsettled disposition and
straitened circumstances also contributed to render his home
uncomfortable. Like most other artists of that period, he appears to
have frequently travelled; but his journeys do not seem to have extended
beyond Switzerland and Suabia, and they were for the most part confined
to the former country. He seems to have travelled rather in search of
employment than to improve himself by studying the works
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page373" id = "page373">
373</a></span>
of other masters. Perhaps of all the eminent painters of that period
there is no one whose style is more original than Holbein’s, nor one who
owes less to the study of the works of his contemporaries or
predecessors. Though there can be no doubt of his talents being highly
appreciated by his fellow-townsmen, yet his profession during his
residence at Basle appears to have afforded him but a scanty income. The
number of works executed by him between 1517 and 1526 sufficiently
testify that he was not deficient in industry, and the exercise of his
art seems to have been sufficiently varied:&mdash;he painted portraits
and historical subjects; decorated the interior walls of houses,
according to the fashion of that period, with fanciful and historical
compositions; and made designs for goldsmiths and wood-engravers. It is
said that so early as 1520, the Earl of Arundel,<a class = "tag" name =
"tagVI50" id = "tagVI50" href = "#noteVI50">VI.50</a> an English
nobleman, having seen some of his works in passing through Basle,
advised him to try his fortune in England. If such advice were given to
Holbein at that period, it is certain that it was not adopted until
several years after, for he did not visit this country till 1526.</p>

<p>Before he left Basle he had painted two or three portraits of
Erasmus, and there is a large wood-cut of that distinguished scholar
which is said not only to have been painted, but also engraved by
Holbein. This cut is of folio size, and the figure of Erasmus is a whole
length. His right arm rests upon a terminus, and from a richly
ornamented arch is suspended a tablet, with the inscription, <span class
= "smallcaps">Er. Rot.</span> Some old impressions have two verses
printed underneath, which merely praise the likeness without alluding to
the painter, while others have four which contain a compliment to the
genius of Erasmus and to the art of Holbein.<a class = "tag" name =
"tagVI52" id = "tagVI52" href = "#noteVI52">VI.52</a> The original block
is still preserved in the Public Library at Basle; but there is not the
slightest reason for believing that it was engraved by Holbein. In 1526
Holbein left Basle for England: Patin says, because he could no longer
bear to live with his imperious wife. Though this might not be the chief
cause, it is easy to conceive that a person of Holbein’s character would
feel but little regret at parting from such a helpmate. Van Mander says
that he took with him a portrait which he had painted of Erasmus, with a
letter of recommendation from the latter to Sir Thomas More, wherein it
was observed that this portrait ‘was
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page374" id = "page374">
374</a></span>
much more like him than any of Albert Durer’s.’ Hegner, however, thinks
that what Van Mander says about the contents of this letter is not
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page375" id = "page375">
375</a></span>
correct, as no such passage is to be found in the published
correspondence of Erasmus with Sir Thomas More. Erasmus had already sent
two portraits of himself to England;<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI53" id
= "tagVI53" href = "#noteVI53">VI.53</a> and as Sir Thomas More was
personally acquainted with him, Hegner is of opinion that it would be
unnecessary to mention that the portrait was a better likeness than any
of those painted by Albert Durer. It is, however, by no means unlikely
that Erasmus in speaking of a portrait of himself by
Holbein&mdash;whether forwarded by the latter or not&mdash;might give
his own opinion of it in comparison with one from the pencil of
Durer.</p>

<p>It would appear that in 1525 Erasmus had already mentioned Holbein’s
desire of trying his fortune in England to Sir Thomas More, for in a
letter written by Sir Thomas to Erasmus, dated from the court at
Greenwich, 18th of December 1525, there is a passage to the following
effect: “Your painter, dear Erasmus, is an excellent artist, but I am
apprehensive that he will not find England so fruitful and fertile as he
may expect. I&nbsp;will, however, do all that I can in order that he may
not find it entirely barren.”<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI54" id =
"tagVI54" href = "#noteVI54">VI.54</a> From a letter, dated 29th of
August 1526, written by Erasmus to his friend Petrus Aegidius at
Antwerp, it seems reasonable to conclude that Holbein left Basle for
England about the beginning of September. Though Holbein’s name is not
expressly mentioned in this letter, there cannot be a doubt of his being
the artist who is thus introduced to Aegidius: “The bearer of this is he
who painted my portrait. I&nbsp;will not annoy you with his praises,
although he is indeed an excellent artist. Should he wish to see
Quintin, and you not have leisure to go with him, you can let a servant
show him the house. The arts perish here; he proceeds to England to gain
a few angels; if you wish to write [to England] you can send your
letters by him.”<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI55" id = "tagVI55" href =
"#noteVI55">VI.55</a> In this extract we discover a trait of the usual
prudence of Erasmus, who, in introducing his humbler friends to persons

<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page376" id = "page376">

from the warmth of his recommendations. How gently, yet significantly,
does he hint to Aegidius that the poor painter who brings the letter is
a person about whom he need give himself no trouble: if he has not
<i>leisure</i> to introduce him personally to Quintin&mdash;that is,
Quintin Matsys&mdash;he can send a servant to show him his house. The
suggestion of the servant was a hint from Erasmus that he did not expect
the master to go with Holbein himself.</p>

<p>Holbein on his arrival in England appears to have been well received
by Sir Thomas More; and it is certain that he resided for some time with
the learned and witty chancellor in his house at Chelsea. It is indeed
said that he continued with him for three years, but Walpole thinks that
this is very unlikely. Whether he may have resided during the whole of
the intermediate time with Sir Thomas More or not, there seems reason to
believe that Holbein entered the service of Henry VIII. in 1528. About
the autumn of 1529<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI56" id = "tagVI56" href
= "#noteVI56">VI.56</a>, he paid a short visit to Basle, probably to see
his family, which he had left in but indifferent circumstances, and to
obtain permission from the magistracy for a further extension of his
leave of absence, for no burgher of the city of Basle was allowed to
enter into the service of a foreign prince without their sanction.
Patin, in his Life of Holbein, says that during his visit he spent most
of his time with his old tavern companions, and that he treated the more
respectable burghers, who wished to cultivate his friendship, with great
disrespect. Hegner, however, considers all those accounts which
represent Holbein as a man of intemperate habits and dissolute
character, as unworthy of credit; in his opinion it seems impossible
that he who was a favourite of Henry VIII, and so long an inmate of Sir
Thomas More’s house, should have been a dissolute person. M.&nbsp;Hegner
throughout his work shows a praiseworthy regard for Holbein’s moral
character, but his presumption in this instance is not sufficient to
counterbalance the unfavourable reports in the opposite scale.</p>

<p>About the latter end of 1532, or the beginning of 1533, Holbein again
visited Basle; and his return appears to have been chiefly
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page377" id = "page377">
377</a></span>
influenced by an order of the magistracy, which was to the following
effect: “To M.&nbsp;Hans Holbein, painter, now in England. We Jacob
Meier, burgomaster and councillor, herewith salute you our beloved Hans
Holbein, fellow-burgher, and give you to understand that it is our
desire that you return home forthwith. In order that you may live easier
at home, and provide for your wife and child,<a class = "tag" name =
"tagVI57" id = "tagVI57" href = "#noteVI57">VI.57</a> we are pleased to
allow you the yearly sum of thirty guilders, until we can obtain for you
something better. That you may make your arrangements accordingly, we
acquaint you with this resolution. Given, Monday, 2nd September 1532.”<a
class = "tag" name = "tagVI58" id = "tagVI58" href =
"#noteVI58">VI.58</a> It is uncertain how long Holbein remained at Basle
on his second visit, but it was probably of short duration. Though he
obeyed the summons of the magistracy to return, he seems to have had
sufficient interest to obtain a further extension of his leave of
absence. For the third and last time he revisited Basle in 1538; and
from a licence, signed by the burgomaster Jacob Meier, dated 16th
November in that year, it appears that he obtained permission to return
to England and remain there for two years longer. In this licence fifty
guilders per annum are promised to Holbein on his return to Basle, and
till then the magistrates further agree to allow his wife forty guilders
per annum to be paid quarterly, and the first quarter’s payment to
commence on the eve of St. Lucia next ensuing,&mdash;that is, on the
12th of December. As the mention of the allowance to Holbein’s wife
would seem to imply that she was not very well provided for by her
husband, Hegner attempts to excuse his apparent neglect by suggesting
“that the great sometimes forget to pay, and will not bear dunning;” and
in illustration of this he refers to the passage in Albert Durer’s
Journal which has been previously given at page 269.</p>

<p>Holbein’s three visits to Basle have been here especially noticed in
order that the reader might judge for himself as to the probability of
his making the drawings for the Lyons Dance of Death on any of those
occasions. As this work was published in 1538, and as Holbein on his
last visit appears to have arrived at Basle about the beginning of
September in that year, it is impossible that he should have made the
drawings then; for if the forty-one cuts were executed by one
person&mdash;as
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page378" id = "page378">
378</a></span>
from the similarity and excellence of the style there seems every reason
to believe&mdash;it would require at the least half a year to engrave
them, supposing that the artist worked as expeditiously as a wood
engraver of modern times. As it is highly probable that Holbein both
made designs and painted on his former visits, in 1529, and in 1532 or
1533, I&nbsp;think it most likely that they were made on the latter
occasion,&mdash;that is, supposing them to have been designed on one of
those visits. It is, however, just as probable that the designs were
made in England, and forwarded to a wood engraver at Basle.</p>

<p>Of the various paintings executed by Holbein during his residence in
England it is not necessary to give any account here; those who wish for
information on this point are referred to Walpole’s Anecdotes of
Painting.<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI59" id = "tagVI59" href =
"#noteVI59">VI.59</a> Of his life in England there are few particulars.
“In some household accounts of Henry VIII,” says Mr. Douce, “there are
payments to him in 1538, 1539, 1540, and 1541, on account of his salary,
which appears to have been thirty pounds per annum. From this time
little more is recorded of him till 1553, when he painted Queen Mary’s
portrait, and shortly afterwards died of the plague in 1554.” Thomas
Howard, Earl of Arundel, the great patron of artists, in the time of
Charles I, was desirous of erecting a monument to the memory of Holbein,
but gave up the intention as he was unable to discover the place of the
artist’s interment. As Holbein seems to have left no will, and as his
death appears to have excited no notice, it is likely that he died poor,
and in comparative obscurity. If his satirical drawings<a class = "tag"
name = "tagVI60" id = "tagVI60" href = "#noteVI60">VI.60</a> of Christ’s
Passion, ridiculing the Pope and the popish clergy, were known to Mary,
or any of her spiritual advisers, it could not be expected that he
should find favour at her court.</p>

<p>Wood engraving in England during the time of Holbein’s residence in
this country appears to have been but little cultivated; but though
there cannot be a doubt that the art was then practised here by native
wood
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page379" id = "page379">
379</a></span>
engravers, yet I very much question if it were practised by any person
in England as a distinct profession. It is not unlikely that many of the
wood-cuts which appear in books printed in this country about that
period were engraved by the printers themselves. It has indeed been
supposed that most of the wood-cuts in English books printed at that
period were engraved on the continent; but this opinion seems highly
improbable&mdash;there could be no occasion to send abroad to have
wood-cuts so rudely executed. Perhaps the difficulty, or rather the
impossibility of finding a wood engraver in England capable of doing
justice to his designs might be one reason why Holbein made so few for
the booksellers of this country during his long residence here. The
following portrait of Sir Thomas Wyatt, the poet, who died in 1541, was
probably drawn on the block by Holbein. It is given on the reverse of
the title of a small work in quarto, printed at London, 1542, and
entitled “Næniæ in mortem Thomæ Viati equitis incomparabilis. Joanne
Lelando antiquario autore.” The verses, which are printed underneath the
cut, seem decisive of the drawing having been made by Holbein. There is
a drawing of Sir Thomas Wyatt by Holbein, in the Royal Collection, which
is engraved in Chamberlain’s work, entitled “Imitations of Original
Drawings by Hans Holbein,” folio, 1792. There is little similarity
between the drawing and the cut, though on comparison it is evident that
both are intended for the same person.</p>

<p>It has been supposed that the original cut, of which the preceding is
a fac-simile, was engraved by Holbein himself: if this were true, and
the cut itself taken as a specimen of his abilities in this department
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page380" id = "page380">
380</a></span>

wood engraver, for though there be considerable expression of character
in the drawing of the head, the cut is executed in a very inferior style
of art.</p>

<p>The cuts in Cranmer’s Catechism, a small octavo, printed in 1548,<a
class = "tag" name = "tagVI61" id = "tagVI61" href =
"#noteVI61">VI.61</a> have been ascribed to Holbein; but out of the
whole number, twenty-nine, including the cut on the reverse of the
title, there are only two which contain his mark. In the others the
manner of pencilling is so unlike that of these two, and the drawing and
composition bear so little resemblance to Holbein’s usual style, that I
do not believe them to have been of his designing. In the cut on the
reverse of the title, the subject is Cranmer presenting the Bible to
Edward VI.; the others, twenty-eight in number, but containing only
twenty-six different subjects,&mdash;as two of them are
repeated,&mdash;are illustrative of different passages of Scripture
cited in the work. The following cut is one of those designed by
Holbein. It occurs at folio CL as an illustration of “the fyrst sermon.
A&nbsp;declaration of the fyrst peticion” [of the Lord’s Prayer].
Holbein’s initials, H.&nbsp;H.&mdash;though the cross stroke of the
first H is broken away&mdash;are perceived on the edge of what seems to
be a book, to the left of the figure praying.</p>

<p>For the purpose of showing the difference of style between those two
cuts and the others contained in the same work, the three given on the
following page have been selected. The first, illustrating the Creation,
occurs at the folio erroneously numbered <span class =

<p>The feebleness of the drawing and the want of distinctness in these
three cuts, are totally unlike the more vigorous delineation of Holbein,
as exemplified, though but imperfectly, in the two which are doubtlessly
of his designing. None of them have the slightest
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page383" id = "page383">
383</a></span>
pretensions to delicacy or excellence of engraving, though they may be
considered as the best that had been executed in this country up to that
time. Those which, in my opinion, were not designed by Holbein have the
appearance of having been engraved on a <i>frushy</i> kind of wood, of
comparatively coarse grain. It is not, however, unlikely that this
appearance might result from the feebleness of the drawing, conjoined
with want of skill on the part of the engraver.</p>

<p>The following cut will not perhaps form an inappropriate termination
to the notice of the principal wood engravings which have been ascribed
to Holbein. It occurs as an illustration of the generation of Christ,
Matthew, chapter&nbsp;<span class = "smallroman">I</span>, in an edition
of the New Testament, printed at Zurich, by Froschover, in 1554,<a class

year of Holbein’s death. Though there be no name to this cut, yet from

little doubt of the design being his.</p>

<p>The three following specimens of the cuts in Tindale’s Translation of

chronological order, to have preceded those of the Dance of Death; but
as Holbein holds the same rank in this chapter as Durer in the
preceding, it seemed preferable to give first a connected account of the
principal wood-cuts which are generally ascribed to him, and which
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page385" id = "page385">
385</a></span>
there is the strongest reason to believe were actually of his designing.
The celebrity of Tindale’s translation, as the earliest English version
of the New Testament which appeared in print, and the place which his
name occupies in the earlier part of the history of the Reformation in
England, will give an interest to those cuts to which they could have no
pretensions as mere works of art. It is probable that they were executed
at Antwerp, where the book was printed; and the drawing and engraving
will afford some idea of the style of most of the small cuts which are
to be found in works printed in Holland and Flanders about that period.
The first of the preceding cuts represents St. Luke employed in painting
a figure of the Virgin, and it occurs at the commencement of the Gospel
of that Evangelist. The second, which occurs at the commencement of the
General Epistle of James, represents that Saint in the character of a
pilgrim. The third, Death on the Pale Horse, is an illustration of the
sixth chapter of Revelations.</p>

beautifully illuminated; the whole of the ornamental border, which is
seen in the copies on paper, is covered with gilding and colour, and the
wood-cut of the printer’s mark is covered with the blazoning of the
royal arms. On the edges, which are gilt, there is inscribed, in red

Zurich by Christopher Froschover. The dedication is addressed to Henry
VIII, by “his Graces humble subjecte and daylie oratour, Myles
Coverdale;” and in the copy in the British Museum the commencement is as
follows: “Unto the most victorious Prynce and our most gracyous
soveraigne Lorde, kynge Henry the eyght, kynge of Englonde and of
Fraunce, lorde of Irlonde, &amp;c.&nbsp;Defendour of the Fayth, and
under God the chefe and supreme heade of the churche of Englonde. ¶The
ryght and just administracyon of the laws that God gave unto Moses and
unto Josua: the testimonye of faythfulnes that God gave of David: the
plenteous abundance of wysdome that God gave unto Salomon: the lucky and
prosperous age with the multiplicacyon of sede which God gave unto
Abraham and Sara his wyfe, he gevē unto you most Gracyous Prynce, with
your dearest just wyfe and most virtuous Pryncesse, Quene Anne. Amen.”
In most copies, however, “Quene Jane” is substituted for “Quene Anne,”
which proves that the original dedication had been cancelled after the
disgrace and execution of Anne Boleyn, and that, though the colophon is
dated 4th October 1535, the work had not been generally circulated until
subsequent to 20th May 1536, the date of Henry’s marriage with Jane
Seymour.</p>

<p>This edition contains a number of wood-cuts, all rather coarsely
engraved, though some of them are designed with such spirit as to be not
unworthy of Holbein himself, as will be apparent from two or three of
the following specimens. In the first, Cain killing Abel, the attitude
of Abel, and the action of Cain, sufficiently indicate that the original
designer understood the human figure well, and could draw it with great
force in a position which it is most difficult to represent.</p>

<p>The three next cuts are from the New Testament. The first forms the
head-piece to the Gospel of St. Matthew; the second, which occurs on the
title-page, and displays great power of drawing in the figure, is John
the Baptist; and the third represents St. Paul writing, with his sword
before him, and a weaver’s loom to his left: the last incident,
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page388" id = "page388">

which is frequently introduced in old wood-cuts of this Saint, is
probably intended to designate his business as a tentmaker, and also to
indicate that, though zealously engaged in disseminating the doctrines
of Christ, he had not ceased to “work with his hands.”</p>

<p>Many of the cuts in this work are copied in a subsequent edition,
also in folio, printed in 1537; and some of the copies are so extremely
like the originals&mdash;every line being retained&mdash;as to induce a
suspicion that the impressions of the latter had been transferred to the
blocks by means of what is technically termed “rubbing down.”</p>

<p>About 1530 the art of chiaro-scuro engraving on wood, which appears
to have been first introduced into Italy by Ugo da Carpi, was practised
by Antonio Fantuzzi, called also Antonio da Trente. Most of this
engraver’s chiaro-scuros are from the designs of Parmegiano. It is said
that Fantuzzi was employed by Parmegiano for the express purpose of
executing chiaro-scuro engravings from his drawings, and that, when
residing with his employer at Bologna, he took an opportunity of robbing
him of all his blocks, impressions, and designs. Between 1530 and 1540
Joseph Nicholas Vincentini da Trente engraved several chiaro-scuros,
most of which, like those executed by Fantuzzi, are from the designs of
Parmegiano. From the number of chiaro-scuros engraved after drawings by
this artist, I&nbsp;think it highly probable that the most of them were
executed under his own superintendence and published for his own
benefit. Baldazzar Peruzzi and Domenico Beccafumi, both painters of
repute at that period, are said to have engraved in chiaro-scuro; but
the prints in this style usually ascribed to them are not numerous, and
I consider it doubtful if they were actually of their own engraving.</p>

<p>From about 1530, the art of wood engraving, in the usual manner,
began to make considerable progress in Italy, and many of the cuts
executed in that country between 1540 and 1580 may vie with the best
wood engravings of the same period executed in Germany. Instead of the
plain and simple style, which is in general characteristic of Italian
wood-cuts previous to 1530, the wood engravers of that country began to
execute their subjects in a more delicate and elaborate manner. In the
period under consideration, we find cross-hatching frequently introduced
with great effect; there is a greater variety of <i>tint</i> in the
cuts; the texture of different substances is indicated more correctly;
the foliage of trees is more natural; and the fur and feathers of
animals are discriminated with considerable ability.</p>

<p>The following cut will afford perhaps some idea of the best Italian
wood-cuts of the period under consideration. It is a reduced copy of the
frontispiece to Marcolini’s Sorti,<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI66" id =
"tagVI66" href = "#noteVI66">VI.66</a> folio, printed at Venice in 1540.

There is an impression of this cut on paper of a greenish tint in the
Print Room of the British Museum, and from this circumstance it is
placed, though improperly, in a volume, marked I.&nbsp;W. 4, and
lettered “Italian chiaro-scuros.” Underneath this impression the late
Mr. Ottley has written, “Not in Bartsch;” and from his omitting to
mention the work for which it was engraved, I&nbsp;am inclined to think
that he himself was not aware of its forming the frontispiece to
Marcolini’s Sorti. Papillon, speaking of the supposed engraver, Joseph
Porta Garfagninus, whose name is seen on a tablet near the bottom
towards the right, says, “J’ai de lui une fort belle Académie des
Sciences,”<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI67" id = "tagVI67" href =
"#noteVI67">VI.67</a> but seems not to have known of the work to which
it belonged. This cut is merely a copy, reversed, of a study by Raffaele
for his celebrated fresco, usually
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page391" id = "page391">
391</a></span>
called the School of Athens, in the Vatican. It is engraved in a work
entitled “Vies et Oeuvres des Peintres les plus célèbres,” 4to. Paris,
1813; and in the Table des Planches at the commencement of the volume in
which it occurs, the subject is thus described: “Pl. <span class =
"smallroman">CCCCV.</span> Etude pour le tableau de l’Ecole d’Athènes.
Ces différens episodes ne se retrouvant pas dans le tableau qui a été
exécuté des mains de Raphaël, ne doivent être considérées que comme des
essais ou premières pensées. <i>Grav. M.&nbsp;Ravignano.</i>” From this
description it appears that the same subject had been previously
engraved on copper by Marco da Ravenna, who flourished about the year
1530. Though I have never seen an impression of Marco’s engraving of
this subject, and though it is not mentioned in Heineken’s catalogue of
the engraved works of Raffaele,<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI68" id =

<p>The wood engravers of Venice about the middle of the sixteenth
century appear to have excelled all other Italian wood engravers, and
for the delicacy of their execution they rivalled those of Lyons, who at
that period were chiefly distinguished for the neat and delicate manner
of their engraving small subjects. In the pirated edition of the Lyons
Dance of Death, published at Venice in 1545 by V.&nbsp;Vaugris, the cuts
are more correctly copied and more delicately engraved than
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page394" id = "page394">
394</a></span>
those in the edition first published at Cologne by the heirs of Arnold
Birkman in 1555. In fact, the wood engravings in books printed at Lyons
and Venice from about 1540 to 1580 are in general more delicately
engraved than those executed in Germany and the Low Countries during the
same period. Among all the Venetian printers of that age, Gabriel
Giolito is entitled to precedence from the number and comparative
excellence of the wood-cuts contained in the numerous illustrated works
which issued from his press. In several of the works printed by him
every cut is surrounded by an ornamental border; and this border, not
being engraved on the same block as the cut, but separately as a kind of
frame, is frequently repeated: sixteen different borders, when the book
is of octavo size and there is a cut on every page, would suffice for
the whole work, however extensive it might be. The practice of
<i>ornamenting</i> cuts in this manner was very prevalent about the
period under consideration, and at the present time some publishers seem
inclined to revive it. I&nbsp;should, however, be sorry to see it again
become prevalent, for though to some subjects, designed in a particular
manner, an ornamental border may be appropriate, yet I consider the
practice of thus <i>framing</i> a series of cuts as indicative of bad
taste, and as likely to check the improvement of the art. Highly
ornamented borders have, in a certain degree, the effect of reducing a
series of cuts, however different their execution, to a standard of
mediocrity; for they frequently conceal the beauty of a well-engraved
subject, and serve as a screen to a bad one. In Ludovico Dolce’s
Transformationi&mdash;a translation, or rather paraphrase of Ovid’s
Metamorphoses&mdash;first printed by Giolito in 1553, and again
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page395" id = "page395">
395</a></span>
in 1557, the cuts, instead of having a border all round, have only
ornaments at the two vertical sides. The preceding is a fac-simile of
one of those cuts, divested of its ornaments, from the edition of 1557.
The subject is the difficult labour of Alcmena,&mdash;a favourite with
Italian artists. This is the cut previously alluded to at <a href =

<p>A curious book, of which an edition, in quarto, was printed at Rome
in 1561, seems deserving of notice here, not on account of any merit in
the wood-cuts which it contains, but on account of the singularity of
four of them, which are given as a specimen of a “Sonetto figurato,” in
the manner of the cuts in a little work entitled “A&nbsp;curious
Hieroglyphick Bible,” first printed in London, in duodecimo, about 1782.
The Italian work in question was written by “Messer Giovam Battista
Palatino, Cittadino Romano,” and from the date of the Pope’s grant to
the author of the privilege of exclusively printing it for ten years, it
seems likely that the first edition was published about 1540. The work
is a treatise on penmanship; and the title-page of the edition of
1561&mdash;which is embellished with a portrait of the author&mdash;may
be translated as follows: “The Book of M.&nbsp;Giovam Battista Palatino,
citizen of Rome, in which is taught the manner of writing all kinds of
characters, ancient and modern, of whatever nation, with Rules,
Proportions, and Examples. Together with a short and useful Discourse on
Cyphers. Newly revised and corrected by the Author. With the addition of
fifteen beautiful cuts.”<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI72" id = "tagVI72"
href = "#noteVI72">VI.72</a> In Astle’s Origin and Progress of Writing,
page 227, second edition, Palatino’s work is thus noticed: “In 1561,
Valerius Doricus printed at Rome a curious book on all kinds of writing,
ancient and modern. This book contains specimens of a great variety of
writing practised in different ages and countries; some of these
specimens are printed from types to imitate writing, and others from
carved wood-blocks. This book also contains a treatise on the art of
writing in cipher, and is a most curious specimen of early
typography.”</p>

<p>After his specimens of “Lettere Cifrate,” Palatino devotes a couple
of pages to “Cifre quadrate, et Sonetti figurati,” two modes of
riddle-writing which, it appears, are solely employed for amusement. The
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page396" id = "page396">
396</a></span>
“Cifro quadrato” is nothing more than a monogram, formed of a cluster of
interwoven capitals, but in which every one of the letters of the name
is to be found. In the following specimen the name thus ingeniously
disguised is <span class = "smallcaps">Lavinia</span>.</p>

<p>The following is a slightly reduced copy of the first four lines of
the “Sonetto figurato;” the other ten lines are expressed by figures in
a similar manner. “As to figured sonnets,” says the author, “no better
rule can be given, than merely to observe that the figures should
clearly and distinctly correspond with the matter, and that there should
be as few supplementary letters as possible. Of course, orthography and
pure
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page397" id = "page397">
397</a></span>
Italian are not to be looked for in such exercises; and it is no
objection that the same figure be used for the beginning of one word,
the middle of another, or the end of a third. It is the chief excellence
of such compositions that there should be few letters to be
supplied.”</p>

<p>The “interpretatio” of the preceding figured text is as follows:</p>

</div>

<p>This figured sonnet is a curious specimen of hieroglyphic and
“phonetic” writing combined. For those who do not understand Italian, it
seems necessary to give the following explanation of the words, and
point out their phonetic relation to the things. <i>Dove</i>, where, is
composed of <i>D</i>, and <i>ove</i>, eggs, as seen at the commencement
of the first line. <i>Son</i>, are, is represented by a man’s head and a
trumpet, making a sound, <i>son</i>. The preceding figures are examples
of what is called “phonetic” writing, by modern expounders of Egyptian
antiquities,&mdash;that is, the figures of <i>things</i> are not placed
as representatives of the things themselves, but that their names when
pronounced may form a word or part of a word, which has generally not
the least relation to the thing by which it is <i>phonetically</i>, that
is, vocally, expressed. <i>Occhi</i>, eyes, is an instance of
hieroglyphic writing; the figure and the idea to be represented agree.
<i>La</i>, the, is represented by the musical note <i>la</i>;
<i>serena</i>, placid, by a
Siren,&mdash;<i>Sirena</i>,&mdash;orthography, as the author says, is
not to be expected in figured sonnets; and <i>forma</i>, shape, by a
shoemaker’s last, which is called <i>forma</i> in Italian.</p>

<p>In the second line, <i>Santo</i>, holy, is represented by a Saint,
<i>Santo</i>; <i>allegro</i>, cheerfulness, by a pair of wings,
<i>ale</i>, and <i>grue</i>, a crane, the superfluous <i>e</i> forming,
with the <span class = "smallroman">T</span> following, the conjunction
<i>et</i>, and. The words <i>amoroso aspetto</i> are formed of
<i>amo</i>, a hook, <i>rosa</i>, a rose, and <i>petto</i>, the breast,
with a supplementary <i>s</i> between the rose and the breast.</p>

<p>In the third line we have <i>ove</i>, eggs, and the musical <i>la</i>
again; <i>man</i>, the hand, is expressed by its proper figure;
<i>eburna</i>, ivory-like, is composed of the letters <span class =
"smallroman">EB</span> and an urn, <i>urna</i>; and in the latter part
of the line the eggs, <i>ov’</i>, and the breast, <i>petto</i>, are
repeated.</p>

<p>At the commencement of the fourth line, a couple of cloaks,
<i>cappe</i>, stand for <i>ch’ appe</i> in the compound word <i>ch’
appe</i>nsarvi; <i>hor’</i>, now, is represented by an hour-glass,
<i>hora</i>, literally, an hour; <i>fonte</i>, a fountain, is expressed
by its proper figure; and the words <i>mi transforma</i>, are
phonetically expressed by a mitre, <i>mitra</i>, the supplementary
letters <span class = "smallroman">NS</span>, and the shoemaker’s last,
<i>forma</i>.</p>

<p>In the reign of Queen Elizabeth, a taste for inventing devices in
this manner seems to have been fashionable among professed wits; and the
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page398" id = "page398">
398</a></span>
practice of expressing a name by a rebus was not unfrequent in an
earlier age. It is probable that the old sign of the Bolt-in-Tun in
Fleet Street derives its origin from Bolton, a&nbsp;prior of St.
Bartholomew’s in Smithfield, who gave a bird-<i>bolt</i> in the
bung-hole of a <i>tun</i> as the rebus of his name. The peculiarities of
the Italian figured sonnet are not unaptly illustrated in Camden’s
Remains, in the chapter entitled “<i>Rebus,<a class = "tag" name =
"tagVI73" id = "tagVI73" href = "#noteVI73">VI.73</a> or
Name-Devises</i>:” “Did not that amorous youth mystically expresse his
love to <i>Rose Hill</i>, whom he courted, when in a border of his
painted cloth he caused to be painted as rudely as he devised grossely,
a&nbsp;rose, a&nbsp;hill, an eye, a&nbsp;loafe, and a well,&mdash;that
is, if you will spell it,</p>

<p>Among the wood engravers of Lyons who flourished about the middle of
the sixteenth century, the only one whose name has come down to modern
times is Bernard Solomon; and if he were actually the engraver of the
numerous cuts which are ascribed to him, he must have been extremely
industrious. I&nbsp;am not, however, aware of any cut which contains his
mark; and it is by no means certain whether he were really a wood
engraver, or whether he only made the designs for wood engravers to
execute. Papillon, who has been blindly followed by most persons who
have either incidentally or expressly written on wood engraving,
unhesitatingly claims him as a wood engraver; but looking at the
inequality in the execution of the cuts ascribed to him, and regarding
the sameness of character in the designs, I&nbsp;am inclined to think
that he was not an engraver, but that he merely made the drawings on the
wood. Sir E.&nbsp;L. Bulwer has committed a mistake of this kind in his
England and the English: “This country,” says he in his second volume,
page 205, edition 1833, “may boast of having, in Bewick of Newcastle,
brought wood engraving to perfection; his pupil, Harvey, continues the
profession with reputation.” The writer here evidently speaks of that
which he knows very little about, for at the time that his book was
published, Harvey, though originally a wood engraver, and a pupil of
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page399" id = "page399">
399</a></span>
Bewick, had abandoned the profession for about eight years, and had
devoted himself entirely to painting and drawing for copper-plate and
wood engravers. Indeed I very much question if Sir Edward Lytton Bulwer
ever saw a cut&mdash;except, perhaps, that of Dentatus,&mdash;which was
actually engraved by Harvey. With about equal propriety, a&nbsp;writer,
speaking of wood engraving in England twenty years ago, might have
described the late John Thurston as “continuing the profession with
reputation,” merely because he was one of the principal designers of
wood engravings at that period.</p>

<p>Bernard Solomon, whether a designer or engraver on wood, is justly
entitled to be ranked among the “little masters” in this branch of art.
All the cuts ascribed to him which have come under my notice are of
small size, and most of them are executed in a delicate manner; they
are, however, generally deficient in effect,<a class = "tag" name =
"tagVI75" id = "tagVI75" href = "#noteVI75">VI.75</a> and may readily be
distinguished by the tall slim figures which he introduces. He evidently
had not understood the “capabilities” of his art, for in none of his
productions do we find the well-contrasted “black-and-white,” which,
when well managed, materially contributes to the excellence of a
well-engraved wood-cut. The production of a good <i>black</i> is,
indeed, one of the great advantages, in point of conventional colour,
which wood possesses over copper; and the wood engraver who neglects
this advantage, and labours perhaps for a whole day to cut with
mechanical precision a number of delicate but unmeaning lines, which a
copper-plate engraver would execute with facility in an hour, affords a
tolerably convincing proof of his not thoroughly understanding the
principles of his art. In Bernard’s cuts, and in most of those executed
at Lyons about the same period, we find much of this ineffective labour;
we perceive in them many evidences of the pains-taking workman, but few
traits of the talented artist. From the time that a taste for those
little and laboriously executed, but spiritless cuts, began to prevail,
the decline of wood engraving may be dated. Instead of confining
themselves within the legitimate boundaries of their own art, wood
engravers seem to have been desirous of emulating the delicacy of
copper-plate engraving, and, as might naturally be expected by any one
who understands the distinctive peculiarities of the two arts, they
failed. The book-buyers of the period having become sickened with the
glut of tasteless
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page400" id = "page400">
400</a></span>
and ineffective trifles, wood engraving began to decline: large
well-engraved wood-cuts executed between 1580 and 1600 are comparatively
scarce.</p>

<p>Bernard Solomon, or, as he is frequently called, <i>Little</i>
Solomon, from the smallness of his works, is said to have been born in
1512, and the most of the cuts which are ascribed to him appeared in
works printed at Lyons between 1545 and 1580. Perhaps more books
containing small wood-cuts were printed at Lyons between those years
than in any other city or town in Europe during the corresponding
period. It appears to have been the grand mart for Scripture cuts,
emblems, and devices; but out of the many hundreds which appear to have
been engraved there in the period referred to, it would be difficult to
select twenty that can be considered really excellent both in execution
and design. One of the principal publishers of Lyons at that time was
Jean de Tournes; many of the works which issued from his press display
great typographic excellence, and in almost all the cuts are engraved
with great neatness. The following cut is a fac-simile of one which
appears in the title-page of an edition of Petrarch’s Sonnetti, Canzoni,
e&nbsp;Trionfi, published by him in a small octodecimo volume, 1545.</p>

<p class = "illustration">

<img src = "images/illus_400.png" width = "188" height = "206"
alt = "see text"></p>

<p>The design of the cut displays something of the taste for emblem and
device<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI76" id = "tagVI76" href =
"#noteVI76">VI.76</a> which was then so prevalent, and which became so
generally diffused by the frequent editions of Alciat’s Emblems, the
first of which was printed about 1531. The portraits of Petrarch and
Laura, looking not unlike “Philip and Mary on a shilling,” are
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page401" id = "page401">
401</a></span>
seen enclosed within a heart which Cupid has pierced to the very core
with one of his arrows. The volume contains seven other small cuts,
designed and engraved in a style which very much resembles that of the
cuts ascribed to Bernard Solomon; and as there is no mark by which his
productions are to be ascertained, I&nbsp;think they are as likely to be
of his designing as three-fourths of those which are generally supposed
to be of his engraving.</p>

<p>The work entitled “Quadrins Historiques de la Bible,” with wood-cuts,
ascribed to Bernard Solomon, and printed at Lyons by Jean de Tournes,
was undoubtedly suggested by the “Historiarum Veteris Testamenti
Icones”&mdash;Holbein’s Bible-cuts&mdash;first published by the brothers
Frellon in 1538. The first edition of the Quadrins Historiques was
published in octavo about 1550, and was several times reprinted within
the succeeding twenty years. The total number of cuts in the edition of
1560 is two hundred and twenty-nine, of which no less than one hundred
and seventy are devoted to the illustration of Exodus and Genesis. At
the top of each is printed the reference to the chapter to which it
relates, and at the bottom is a “Quadrin poëtique, tiré de la Bible,
pour graver en la table des affeccions l’amour des sacrees Histories.”
Those “Quadrins” appear to have been written by Claude Paradin. The
composition of several of the cuts is good, and nearly all display great
<i>neatness</i> of execution. The following is a fac-simile of the
seventh, Adam and Eve driven out of Paradise. It is, however, necessary
to observe that this is by no means one of the best cuts either in point
of design or execution.</p>

<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page402" id = "page402">

<p>A similar work, entitled “Figures du Nouveau Testament,” with cuts,
evidently designed by the person who had made the drawings for those in
the “Quadrins Historiques de la Bible,” was also published by Jean de
Tournes about 1553, and several editions were subsequently printed. The
cuts are rather less in size than those of the Quadrins, and are, on the
whole, rather better engraved. The total number is a hundred and four,
and under each are six explanatory verses, composed by Charles Fonteine,
who, in a short poetical address at the commencement, dedicates the work
“A&nbsp;Tres-illustre et Treshaute Princesse, Madame Marguerite de
France, Duchesse de Berri.” The following, Christ tempted by Satan, is a
copy of the sixteenth cut, but like that of the expulsion of Adam and
Eve, it is not one of the best in the work.</p>

<p>Old engravings and paintings illustrative of manners or of costume
are generally interesting; and on this account a set of large wood-cuts
designed by Peter Coeck of Alost, in Flanders, is deserving of notice.
The subjects of those cuts are the manners and costumes of the Turks;
and the drawings were made on the spot by Coeck himself, who visited
Turkey in 1533. It is said that he brought from the east an important
secret relative to the art of dyeing silk and wool for the fabrication
of tapestries, a&nbsp;branch of manufacture with which he appears to
have been connected, and for which he made a number of designs. He was
also an architect and an author; and published several treatises on
sculpture, geometry, perspective, and architecture. The cuts
illustrative of the manners and costume of the Turks were not published
until 1553, three years after his decease, as we learn from an
inscription

"#noteVI77">VI.77</a> They are oblong, of folio size; and the seven of
which the set consists are intended to be joined together, and thus to
form one continuous subject. The figures, both on foot and horseback,
are designed with great spirit, but they want relief, and the engraving
is coarse. One of the customs which he has illustrated in the cut
No.&nbsp;3 is singular; and though this <i>orientalism</i> has been
noticed by a Scottish judge&mdash;Maclaurin of Dreghorn&mdash;Peter
Coeck appears to be the only traveller who has graphically represented
“<i>quo modo Turci mingunt</i>,” i.&nbsp;e. <i>sedentes</i>. Succeeding
artists have availed themselves liberally of those cuts. As the Turks in
the sixteenth century were much more formidable as a nation than at
present, and their manners and customs objects of greater curiosity,
wood engravings illustrative of their costume and mode of living appear
to have been in considerable demand at that period, for both in books
and as single cuts they are comparatively numerous.</p>

<p>Though chiaro-scuro engraving on wood was, in all probability, first
practised in Germany, yet the art does not appear to have been so much
cultivated nor so highly prized in that country as in Italy. Between
1530 and 1550, when Antonio Fantuzzi, J.&nbsp;N. Vincentini, and other
Italians, were engaged in executing numerous chiaro-scuros after the
designs of such masters as Raffaele, Corregio, Parmegiano, Polidoro,
Beccafumi, and F.&nbsp;Salviati, the art appears to have been
comparatively abandoned by the wood engravers of Germany. The
chiaro-scuros executed in the latter country cannot generally for a
moment bear a comparison, either in point of design or execution, with
those executed in Italy during the same period. I&nbsp;have, however,
seen one German cut executed in this style, with the date 1543, which,
for the number of the blocks from which it is printed, and the delicacy
of the impression in certain parts, is, if genuine, one of the most
remarkable of that period. As the paper, however, seems comparatively
modern, I&nbsp;am induced to suspect that the date may be that of the
painting or drawing, and that this picture-print&mdash;for, though
executed by the same process, it would be improper to call it a
chiaro-scuro&mdash;may have been the work of Ungher, a&nbsp;German wood
engraver, who executed some chiaro-scuros at Berlin about seventy years
ago. Whatever may be the date, however, or whoever may have been the
artist, it is one of the best executed specimens of coloured block
printing that I have ever seen.</p>

<p>This curious picture-print, including the border, is ten inches and
three quarters high by six inches and three quarters wide. The subject
is a figure of Christ; in his left hand he holds an orb emblematic of
his power, while the right is elevated as in the act of pronouncing a
benediction. His robe is blue, with the folds indicated by a darker
tint, and the border and lighter parts impressed with at least two
lighter colours. Above this robe there is a large red mantle, fastened
in front with what appears to be a jewel of three different colours,
ruby, yellow, and blue; the folds are of a darker colour; and the lights
are expressed by a kind of yellow, which has evidently been either
impressed, or laid on the paper with a brush, before the red colour of
the mantle, and which, from its glistening, seems to have been
compounded with some metallic substance like fine gold-dust. The border
of the print consists of a similar yellow, between plain black lines.
The face is printed in flesh colour of three tints, and the head is
surrounded with rays of glory, which appear like gilding. The engraving
of the face, and of the hair of the head and beard, is extremely well
executed, and much superior to anything that I have seen in wood-cuts
containing Ungher’s mark. The globe is blue, with the lights preserved,
intersected by light red and yellow lines; and the small cross at the
top is also yellow, like the light on the red mantle. The hands and feet
are expressed in their proper colours; the ground on which the Redeemer
stands is something between a lake and a fawn colour; and the ground of
the print, upwards from about an inch above the bottom, is of a lighter
blue than the robe. To the right, near the bottom, are the date and
mark, thus:

The figure like a winged serpent resembles a mark which was frequently
used by Lucas Cranach, except that the serpent or dragon of the latter
appears less crooked, and usually has a ring in its mouth. The letter
underneath also appears rather more like an I than an L.&nbsp;The
drawing of the figure of Christ, however, is very much in the style of
Lucas Cranach, and I am strongly inclined to think that the original
painting or drawing was executed by him, whoever may have been the
engraver. There must have been at least ten blocks required for this
curious print, which, for clearness and distinctness in the colours, and
for delicacy of impression, more especially in the face, may challenge a
comparison not only with the finest chiaro-scuros of former times, but
also with the best specimens of coloured block-printing of the present
day.<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI78" id = "tagVI78" href =

<p>In 1557, Hubert Goltzius, a painter, but better known as an author
than as an artist, published at Antwerp, in folio, a&nbsp;work
containing portraits, executed in chiaro-scuro, of the Roman emperors,
from Julius Cæsar to Ferdinand&nbsp;I.<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI79"
id = "tagVI79" href = "#noteVI79">VI.79</a> Descamps, in his work
entitled “La Vie des Peintres Flamands, Allemands et Hollandois,” says
that those portraits, which are all copied from medals, were “engraved
on wood by a painter of Courtrai, named Joseph Gietleughen;”<a class =
"tag" name = "tagVI80" id = "tagVI80" href = "#noteVI80">VI.80</a> and
Papillon, who had examined the work more closely, but not closely
enough, says that the outlines are etched, and that the two
<i>rentrées</i>&mdash;the subsequent impressions which give to the whole
the appearance of a chiaro-scuro drawing&mdash;are from blocks of wood
engraved in <i>intaglio</i>. What Papillon says about the outlines being
etched is true; but a close inspection of those portraits will afford
any person acquainted with the process ample proof of the “rentrées”
being also printed from plates of metal in the same manner as from
engraved wood-blocks.</p>

<p>Each of those portraits appears like an enlarged copy of a medal, and
is the result of three separate impressions; the first, containing the
outlines of the head, the ornaments, and the name, has been printed from
an etched plate of copper or some other metal, by means of a
copper-plate printing-press; and the two other impressions, over the
first, have also been from plates of metal, mounted on blocks of wood,
and printed by means of the common typographic printing-press. The
outlines of the head and of the letters forming the legend are black;
the field of the medal is a muddy kind of sepia; and the head and the
border, printed from the same surface and at the same time, are of a
lighter shade. The lights to be preserved have been cut in
<i>intaglio</i> in the plates for the two “rentrées” in the same manner
as on blocks of wood for printing in chiaro-scuro. The marks of the pins
by which the two plates for the “rentrées” have been fastened to blocks
of wood, to raise them to a proper height, are very perceptible; in the
field of the medal they appear like circular points, generally in pairs;
while round the outer margin they are mostly of a square form. It is
difficult to conceive what advantage Goltzius might expect to derive by
printing the “rentrées” from metal plates; for all that he has thus
produced could have been more simply effected by means of wood-blocks,
as practised up to that time by all other chiaro-scuro engravers. Though
those portraits possess but little merit as chiaro-scuros, they are yet
highly interesting in the history of art, as affording the first
instances of
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page406" id = "page406">
406</a></span>
etching being employed for the outlines of a chiaro-scuro, and of the
substitution, in surface-printing, of a plate of metal for a wood-block.
Goltzius’s manner of etching the outlines of a chiaro-scuro print was
frequently practised both by French and English artists about the middle
of the last century; and about 1722, Edward Kirkall engraved the
principal parts of his chiaro-scuros in mezzo-tint, and afterwards
printed a tint from a metal plate mounted on wood. In the present day
Mr. George Baxter has successfully applied the principle of engraving
the ground and the outlines of his subjects in aqua-tint; and, as in the
case of Hubert Goltzius and Kirkall, he sometimes uses a metal-plate
instead of a wood-block in surface-printing. In the picture-prints
executed by Mr. Baxter for the Pictorial Album, 1837, the tint of the
paper on which each imitative painting appears to be mounted, is
communicated from a smooth plate of copper, which receives the colour,
and is printed in the same manner as a wood-block.</p>

<p>Among the German artists who made designs for wood engravers from the
time of Durer to about 1590, Erhard Schön, Virgil Solis, Melchior
Lorich, and Jost Amman may be considered as the principal. They are all
frequently described as wood engravers from the circumstance of their
marks being found on the cuts which they undoubtedly designed, but most
certainly did not engrave. Erhard Schön chiefly resided at Nuremberg;
and some of the earliest cuts of his designing are dated 1528. In 1538
he published at Nuremberg a small treatise, in oblong quarto, on the
proportions of the human figure, for the use of students and young
persons.<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI81" id = "tagVI81" href =
"#noteVI81">VI.81</a> This work contains several wood-cuts, all coarsely
engraved, illustrative of the writer’s precepts; two or three of
them&mdash;where the heads and bodies are represented by squares and
rhomboidal figures&mdash;are extremely curious, though apparently not
very well adapted to improve a learner in the art of design. Another of
the cuts, where the proportions are illustrated by means of a figure
inscribed within a circle, is very like one of the illustrations
contained in Flaxman’s Lectures on Sculpture. Some cuts of
playing-cards, designed by Schön, are in greater request than any of his
other works engraved on wood, which, for the most part, have but little
to recommend them. He died about 1550.</p>

<p>Virgil Solis, a painter, copper-plate engraver, and designer on wood,
was born at Nuremberg about 1514. The cuts which contain his mark are
extremely numerous; and, from their being mostly of small size, he is
ranked by Heineken with the “Little Masters.” Several of his cuts
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page407" id = "page407">
407</a></span>
display great fertility of invention; but though his figures are
frequently spirited and the attitudes good, yet his drawing is generally
careless and incorrect. As a considerable number of his cuts are of the
same kind as those of Bernard Solomon, it seems as if there had been a
competition at that time between the booksellers of Nuremberg and those
of Lyons for supplying the European market with illustrations of two
works of widely different character, to wit, the Bible, and Ovid’s
Metamorphoses,&mdash;Virgil Solis being retained for the German, and
Bernard Solomon for the French publishers. He designed the cuts in a
German edition of the Bible, printed in 1560; most of the portraits of
the Kings of France in a work published at Nuremberg in 1566;
a&nbsp;series of cuts for Esop’s fables; and the illustrations of an
edition of Reusner’s Emblems. Several cuts with the mark of Virgil Solis
are to be found in the first edition of Archbishop Parker’s Bible,
printed by Richard Jugge, folio, London, 1568. In the second edition,
1572, there are two ornamented initial letters, apparently of his
designing, which seem to show that his sacred and profane subjects were
liable to be confounded, and that cuts originally designed for an
edition of Ovid might by some singular oversight be used in an edition
of the Bible, although printed under the especial superintendence of a
Right Reverend Archbishop. In the letter G, which forms the commencement
of the first chapter of St. Paul’s Epistle to the Hebrews, the subject
represented by the artist is Leda caressed by Jupiter in the form of a
swan; and in the letter T at the commencement of the first chapter of
the Epistle General of St. John, the subject is Venus before Jove, with
Cupid, Juno, Mars, Neptune, and other Heathen deities in attendance.<a
class = "tag" name = "tagVI82" id = "tagVI82" href =
"#noteVI82">VI.82</a></p>

<p>A series of wood-cuts designed by Virgil Solis, illustrative of
Ovid’s Metamorphoses, was published at Frankfort, in oblong quarto, by
George Corvinus, Sigismund Feyerabend, and the heirs of Wigand Gallus,
in 1569. Each cut is surrounded by a heavy ornamental border; above each
are four verses in Latin, and underneath four in German, composed by
Johannes Posthius, descriptive of the subject. In the title-page,<a
class = "tag" name = "tagVI83" id = "tagVI83" href =
"#noteVI83">VI.83</a> which is both in Latin and in German, it is stated
that they are <i>designed</i>&mdash;<i>gerissen</i>&mdash;by Virgil
Solis for the use and benefit of painters, goldsmiths, and statuaries.
It is thus evident that they were not engraved by him; and in
corroboration of this opinion it may be observed that several
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page408" id = "page408">
408</a></span>
of them, in addition to his mark, <img class = "middle" src =
"images/illus_408a.png" width = "27" height = "18" alt = "symbol">, also
contain another, <img class = "middle" src = "images/illus_408b.png"
width = "20" height = "20" alt = "symbol">, which is doubtless that of
the wood engraver. The latter mark occurs frequently in the cuts
designed by Virgil Solis, in the first edition of Archbishop Parker’s
Bible.</p>

<p>Evelyn, in his Sculptura, has the following notice of this artist:
“Virgilius Solis graved also in wood <i>The story of the Bible</i> and
<i>The mechanic arts</i> in little; but for imitating those vile
postures of Aretine had his eyes put out by the sentence of the
magistrate.” There is scarcely a page of this writer’s works on art
which does not contain similar inaccuracies, and yet he is frequently
quoted and referred to as an authority. The “mechanic arts” to which
Evelyn alludes were probably the series of cuts designed by Jost Amman,
and first published in quarto, at Frankfort, in 1564; and the improbable
story of Virgil Solis having had his eyes put out for copying Julio
Romano’s obscene designs, engraved by Marc Antonio, and illustrated with
sonnets by the scurrilous ribald, Pietro Aretine, is utterly devoid of
foundation. No such copies have ever been mentioned by any well-informed
writer on art, and there is not the slightest evidence of Virgil Solis
ever having been punished in any manner by the magistrates of his native
city, Nuremberg, where he died in 1570.</p>

<p>Wood-cuts with the mark of Melchior Lorich are comparatively scarce.
He was a native of Flensburg in Holstein, and was born in 1527. He
obtained a knowledge of painting and copper-plate engraving at Leipsic,
and afterwards travelled with his master through some of the northern
countries of Europe. He afterwards visited Vienna, and subsequently
entered into the service of the Palsgrave Otho, in whose suite he
visited Holland, France, and Italy. In 1558 he went with the Imperial
ambassador to Constantinople, where he remained three years. His
principal works engraved on wood consist of a series of illustrations of
the manners and customs of the Turks, published about 1570. There is a
very clever cut, a&nbsp;Lady splendidly dressed, with his mark and the
date 1551; it is printed on what is called a “broadside,” and underneath
is a copy of verses by Hans Sachs, the celebrated shoemaker and
<i>meistersänger</i> of Nuremberg,<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI84" id =
"tagVI84" href = "#noteVI84">VI.84</a> entitled “<i>Eer und Lob einer
schön wolgezierten Frawen</i>”&mdash;The Honour and Praise of a
beautiful well-dressed woman. A&nbsp;large cut of the Deluge, in two
sheets, is
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page409" id = "page409">
409</a></span>
considered one of the best of his designing. Among the copper-plates
engraved by Melchior Lorich, a&nbsp;portrait of Albert Durer, and two
others, of the Grand Signior and his favourite Sultana, are among the
most scarce. The time of his death is uncertain, but Bartsch thinks that
he was still living in 1583, as there are wood-cuts with his mark of
that date.</p>

<p>Jost Amman, one of the best designers on wood of the period in which
he lived, was born at Zurich in 1539, but removed to Nuremberg about
1560.<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI85" id = "tagVI85" href =
"#noteVI85">VI.85</a> His designs are more bold, and display more of the
vigour of the older German masters, than those of his contemporary
Virgil Solis. A&nbsp;series of cuts designed by him, illustrative of
professions and trades, was published in 1564, quarto, with the title
“Hans Sachse eigentliche Beschreibung aller Stände auf Erden&mdash;aller
Künste und Handwerker,” &amp;c.&mdash;that is, Hans Sachs’s correct
Description of all Ranks, Arts, and Trades; and another edition in
duodecimo, with the descriptions in Latin, appeared in the same year.<a
class = "tag" name = "tagVI86" id = "tagVI86" href =
"#noteVI86">VI.86</a> For the correctness of the date of those editions
I am obliged to rely on Heineken, as I have never seen a copy of either;
the earliest edition with Hans Sachs’s descriptions that has come under
my notice is dated 1574. In a duodecimo edition, 1568, and another of
the same size, 1574, the descriptions, by Hartman Schopper, are in Latin
verse.<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI87" id = "tagVI87" href =
"#noteVI87">VI.87</a> This is perhaps the most curious and interesting
series of cuts, exhibiting the various ranks and employments of men,
that ever was published. Among the higher orders, constituting what the
Germans call the “<i>Lehre und Wehr Stande</i>”&mdash;teachers and
warriors&mdash;are the Pope, Emperor, King, Princes, Nobles, Priests,
and Lawyers; while almost every branch of labour or of trade then known
in Germany, from agriculture to pin-making, has its representative.
There are also not a few which it would be difficult to reduce to any
distinct class, as they are neither trades nor honest professions. Of
those heteroclytes is the “Meretricum procurator&mdash;der
Hurenweibel”&mdash;or, as Captain Dugald Dalgetty says, “the captain of
the Queans.”</p>

<p>The subject of the following cut, which is of the same size as the
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page410" id = "page410">
410</a></span>
original, is a <i>Briefmaler</i>,&mdash;literally, a&nbsp;card-painter,
the name by which the German wood engravers were known before they
adopted the more appropriate one of <i>Formschneider</i>. It is evident,
that, at the time when the cut was engraved, the two professions were
distinct:<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI88" id = "tagVI88" href =
"#noteVI88">VI.88</a> we here perceive the Briefmaler employed, not in
engraving cuts, but engaged in colouring certain figures by means of a
<i>stencil</i>,&mdash;that is, a&nbsp;card or thin plate of metal, out
of which the intended figure is cut. A&nbsp;brush charged with colour
being drawn over the pierced card, as is seen in the cut, the figure is
communicated to the paper placed underneath. The little shallow vessels
perceived on the top of the large box in front are the saucers which
contain his colours. Near the window, immediately to his right, is a
pile of sheets which, from the figure of a man on horseback seen
impressed upon them, appear to be already finished.</p>

<p>The subject of the following cut, from the same work, is a
<i>Formschneider</i>, or wood engraver proper. He is apparently at work
on a block which he has before him; but the kind of tool which he
employs is not exactly like those used by English wood engravers
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page411" id = "page411">
411</a></span>
of the present day. It seems to resemble a small long-handled
desk-knife; while the tool of the modern wood engraver has a handle
which is rounded at the top in order to accommodate it to the palm of
the hand. It is also never held vertically, as it appears in the hand of
the <i>Formschneider</i>. It is, however, certain, from other woodcuts,
which will be subsequently noticed, that the wood engravers of that
period were accustomed to use a tool with a handle rounded at the top,
similar to the graver used in the present day.<a class = "tag" name =

<p>Jost Amman died in 1591, and from the time of his settling at
Nuremberg to that of his decease he seems to have been chiefly employed
in making designs on wood for the booksellers of Nuremberg and
Frankfort. He also furnished designs for goldsmiths; and
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page412" id = "page412">
412</a></span>
it is said that he excelled as a painter on glass. The works which
afford the best specimens of his talents as a designer on wood are those
illustrative of the costume of the period, first published between 1580
and 1585 by S.&nbsp;Feyerabend at Frankfort. One of those works contains
the costumes of men of all ranks, except the clergy, interspersed with
the armorial bearings of the principal families in Germany; another
contains the costume of the different orders of the priesthood of the
church of Rome; and a third, entitled Gynæceum sive Theatrum Mulierum,
is illustrative of the costume of women of all ranks in Europe.
A&nbsp;work on hunting and fowling, edited by J.&nbsp;A. Lonicerus, and
printed in 1582, contains about forty excellent cuts of his designing.
A&nbsp;separate volume, consisting of cuts selected from the four
preceding works, and of a number of other cuts chiefly illustrative of
mythological subjects and of the costume of Turkey, was published by
Feyerabend about 1590. In a subsequent edition of this work, printed in
1599, it is stated that the collection is published for the especial
benefit of painters and amateurs.<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI90" id =
"tagVI90" href = "#noteVI90">VI.90</a> Among the numerous other cuts
designed by him, the following may be mentioned: illustrations for a
Bible published at Frankfort 1565; a&nbsp;series of subjects from Roman
History, entitled Icones Livianæ, 1572; and the cuts in an edition of
Reynard the Fox. The works of Jost Amman have proved a mine for
succeeding artists; his figures were frequently copied by wood engravers
in France, Italy and Flanders; and even some modern English paintings
contain evidences of the artist having borrowed something more than a
hint from the figures of Jost Amman.</p>

<p>Jost Amman was undoubtedly one of the best professional designers on
wood of his time; and his style bears considerable resemblance to that
of Hans Burgmair as exemplified in the Triumphs of Maximilian. Many of
his figures are well drawn; but even in the best of his subjects the
attitudes are somewhat affected and generally too violent; and this,
with an overstrained expression, makes his characters appear more like
actors in a theatre than like real personages. In the cuts of the horse
in the “Kunstbüchlein” the action of the animal is frequently
represented with great spirit: but in points of detail the
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page413" id = "page413">
413</a></span>
artist is as frequently incorrect. Some of his very best designs are to
be found among his equestrian subjects. His men generally have a good
“seat,” and his ladies seem to manage their heavy long-tailed steeds
with great ease and grace.</p>

<p>Several of the views of cities, in Sebastian Munster’s
Cosmography&mdash;first published in folio, at Basle, 1550&mdash;contain
two marks, one of the designer, and the other of the person by whom the
subject was engraved, the latter being frequently accompanied by a
graver, thus: <img class = "middle" src = "images/illus_413a.png" width
= "39" height = "23" alt = "H·H">; or with two gravers of different
kinds, thus: <img class = "middle" src = "images/illus_413b.png" width =
"69" height = "42" alt = "·C·S·"> This last mark, which also occurs in
Jost Amman’s Kunstbüchlein, is said to be that of Christopher Stimmer,
a&nbsp;brother of Tobias Stimmer, a&nbsp;Swiss artist, who is generally
described as a designer and engraver on wood. The cuts with the former
mark have been ascribed to Hans Holbein, but they bear not the least
resemblance to his style of design, and they have been assigned to him
solely on account of the letters corresponding with the initials of his
name. Professor Christ’s Dictionary of Monograms, and Papillon’s
Treatise on Wood-engraving, afford numerous instances of marks being
assigned to persons on no better grounds.</p>

<p>A writer, in discussing the question, “Were Albert Durer, Lucas
Cranach, Hans Burgmair, and other old German artists, the engravers or
only the designers of the cuts which bear their mark?” has been pleased
to assert that the mark of the actual engraver is usually distinguished
by the graver with which it is accompanied. This statement has been
adopted and further disseminated by others; and many persons who have
not an opportunity of judging for themselves, and who receive with
implicit credit whatever they find asserted in a Dictionary of
Engravers, suppose that from the time of Albert Durer, or even earlier,
the figure of a graver generally distinguishes the mark of the
<i>formschneider</i> or engraver on wood. So far, however, from this
being a general rule, I&nbsp;am not aware of any wood-cut which contains
a graver in addition to a mark of an earlier date than those in
Munster’s Cosmography, and the practice which appears to have been first
introduced about that time never became generally prevalent. When the
graver is thus introduced there can be no doubt that it is intended to
distinguish the mark of the engraver; but as at least ninety-nine out of
every hundred marks on cuts executed between 1550 and 1600 are
unaccompanied with a graver, it is exceedingly doubtful in most cases
whether the mark be that of the engraver or the designer.</p>

<p>The wood-cuts in Munster’s Cosmography are generally poor in design

encounter of two armed men on horseback with the mark <img class =

at Zurich, 1551-1558. This cut, as well as several others, is repeated
in another part of the book, in the manner of the Nuremberg Chronicle,
where the same portrait or the same view is used to represent several
different persons or places. The cuts are not precisely the same in
every edition of Munster’s work, which was several times reprinted
between 1550 and 1570. Those which are substituted in the later editions
are rather more neatly engraved.</p>

<p>The present cut is copied from one at page 49 of the first edition,
where it is given as an illustration of a wonderful kind of tree said to
be found in Scotland, and from the fruit of which it was believed that
geese were produced. Munster’s account of this wonderful tree and its
fruit is as follows; “In Scotland are found trees, the fruit of which
appears like a ball of leaves. This fruit, falling at its proper time
into the water below, becomes animated, and turns to a bird which they
call the <i>tree goose</i>. This tree also grows in the island of Pomona
[the largest of the Orkneys], not far distant from Scotland towards the
north. As old cosmographers&mdash;especially Saxo
Grammaticus&mdash;mention this tree, it is not to be considered as a
fiction of modern authors. Aeneas Sylvius also notices this tree as
follows: ‘We have heard that there was a tree formerly in Scotland,
which, growing by the margin of a stream, produced fruit of the shape of
ducks; that such fruit, when nearly ripe, fell, some into the water and
some on land. Such as fell on land decayed, but such as fell into the
water quickly became animated, swimming below, and then flying into the
air with feathers and wings.

<p>The bird said to be the produce of this tree is the “Bernacle Goose,
Clakis, or Tree Goose” of Bewick; and the pretended <i>tree</i> from
which it was supposed to be produced was undoubtedly a testaceous
insect, a&nbsp;species of which, frequently found adhering to ships’
bottoms, is described under the name of “Lepas <i>Anatifera</i>” by
Linnæus, who thus commemorates in the trivial name the old opinion
respecting its winged and feathered fruit. William Turner, a&nbsp;native
of Morpeth in Northumberland, one of the earliest writers on British
Ornithology, notices the story of the Bernacle Goose being produced from
“something like a fungus proceeding from old wood lying in the sea.” He
says it is mentioned by Giraldus Cambrensis in his description of
Ireland, and that the account of its being generated in this wonderful
manner is generally believed by the people inhabiting the sea-coasts of
England, Scotland, and Ireland. “But,” says Turner, “as it seemed not
safe to trust to popular report, and as, on account of the singularity
of the thing, I&nbsp;could not give entire credit to Giraldus, I, when
thinking of the subject of which I now write, asked a certain clergyman,
named Octavianus, by birth an Irishman, whom I knew to be worthy of
credit, if he thought the account of Giraldus was to be believed. He,
swearing by the Gospel, declared that what Giraldus had written about
the generation of this bird was most true; that he himself had seen and
handled the young unformed birds, and that if I should remain in London
a month or two, he would bring me some of the brood.”<a class = "tag"

and Pena’s Stirpium Adversaria Nova, folio, London, 1570, there is a cut
of the “Britannica Concha Anatifera,” growing on a stalk from a rock,
with figures of ducks or geese in the water below. In the text the
popular belief of a kind of goose being produced from the shell of this
insect is noticed, but the writer declines pronouncing any opinion till
he shall have had an opportunity of visiting Scotland and judging for
himself. Gerard, in his Herbal, London, 1597, has an article on the
<i>Goose-tree</i>; and he says that its native soil is a small island,
called the Pile of Fouldres, half a mile from the main land of
Lancashire. Ferrer

de Valcebro, a&nbsp;Spanish writer, in a work entitled “El Gobierno

about 1680, repeats, with sundry additions, the story of the Bernacle,
or, as he calls it, the Barliata, being produced from a tree; and he
seems rather displeased that his countrymen are not disposed to yield
much faith to such singularities, merely because they do not occur in
their own country.</p>

<p>There are two portraits of Erasmus in the first edition of Munster’s

reader, was engraved after a portrait by Holbein in the possession of
Bonifacius Amerbach. The present is a reduced copy of a cut at page 361

of the same subject, William Tell about to shoot at the apple on his

different and the execution more coarse. The cut from which the
preceding is copied may be ranked among the best in the work.</p>

<p>Though Sebastian Munster, in a letter, probably written in 1538,
addressed to Joachim Vadianus, alludes to an improvement which he and
his printer had made in the mode of printing maps, and to a project for
casting complete words, yet the maps which appear in his Cosmography,
with the outlines, rivers, and mountains engraved on wood, and the names
inserted in type, are certainly not superior to the generality of other
maps executed wholly on wood about the same period.<a class = "tag" name
= "tagVI94" id = "tagVI94" href = "#noteVI94">VI.94</a> Joachim
Vadianus, to whom Munster writes, and of whose assistance he wished to
avail himself in a projected edition of Ptolemy, was an eminent scholar
of that period, and had published an edition, in 1522, of Pomponius
Mela, with a commentary and notes. The passage in Munster’s letter,
wherein maps are mentioned, is to the following effect: “I&nbsp;would
have sent you an impression of one of the Swiss maps which I have had
printed here, if Froschover had not informed me of his having sent you
one from Zurich. If this mode of printing should succeed tolerably well,
and when we shall have acquired a certain art of <i>casting whole
words</i>, Henri Petri, Michael Isengrin, and I have thought of printing
Ptolemy’s Cosmography; not of so great a size as it has hitherto been
frequently printed, but in the form in which your Annotations on
Pomponius appear. In the maps we shall insert only the names of the
principal cities, and give the others alphabetically in some blank
space,&mdash;for instance, in the margin or any adjoining space beyond
the limits of the map.”<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI95" id = "tagVI95"
href = "#noteVI95">VI.95</a> The art of casting whole words, alluded to
in this passage, appears to have been something like an attempt at what
has been called “logographic printing;”<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI96"
id = "tagVI96" href = "#noteVI96">VI.96</a> though it is not unlikely
that
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page418" id = "page418">
418</a></span>
those “whole words” might be the names of countries and places intended
to be inserted in a space cut out of the block on which the map was
engraved. By thus inserting the names, either cast as complete words, or
composed of separate letters, the tedious process of engraving a number
of letters on wood was avoided, and the pressman enabled to print the
maps at one impression. In some of the earlier maps where the names are
printed from types, the letters were not inserted in spaces cut out of
the block, but were printed from a separate form by means of a
“re-iteration” or second impression.<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI97" id
= "tagVI97" href = "#noteVI97">VI.97</a> In illustration of what Munster
says about a certain art of casting whole words,&mdash;“<i>artem aliquam
fundendarum integrarum dictionum</i>,”&mdash;the following extract is
given from Dr. Dibdin’s Bibliographical Tour, volume iii. page 102,
second edition. “What think you of undoubted proofs of <span class =
"smallroman">STEREOTYPE PRINTING</span> in the middle of the sixteenth
century? It is even so. What adds to the whimsical puzzle is, that these
pieces of metal, of which the surface is composed of types, fixed and
immovable, are sometimes inserted in wooden blocks, and introduced as
titles, mottoes, or descriptions of the subjects cut upon the blocks.
Professor May [of Augsburg] begged my acceptance of a specimen or two of
the types thus fixed upon plates of the same metal. They rarely exceeded
the height of four or five lines of text, by about four or five inches
in length. I&nbsp;carried away, with his permission, two proofs (not
long ago pulled) of the same block containing this intermixture of
stereotype and wood-block printing.”</p>

<p>As the engraving of the letters in maps executed on wood&mdash;or
indeed on any other material&mdash;is, when the names of many places are
given, by far the most tedious and costly part of the process, the plan
of inserting them in type by means of holes pierced in the block, as
adopted
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page419" id = "page419">

in Munster’s Cosmography, was certainly a great saving of labour; yet on
comparing the maps in this work with those in Ptolemy’s Cosmography,
printed by Leonard Holl, at Ulm, 1482, and with others engraved in the
early part of the sixteenth century, it is impossible not to perceive
that the art of wood engraving, as applied to the execution of such
works, had undergone no improvement: with the exception of the letters,
the maps in Holl’s Ptolemy&mdash;the earliest that were engraved on
wood&mdash;are, in point of appearance, equal to those in the work of
Munster, published about eighty years later. Considering that the
earliest printed maps&mdash;those in an edition of Ptolemy, printed by
Arnold Bukinck, at Rome, 1478<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI98" id =
"tagVI98" href = "#noteVI98">VI.98</a>&mdash;are from copper-plates, it
seems rather surprising that, until about 1570, no further attempt
should have been made to apply the art of engraving on copper to this
purpose. In the latter year a collection of maps, engraved on copper,<a
class = "tag" name = "tagVI99" id = "tagVI99" href =
"#noteVI99">VI.99</a> was published at Antwerp under the superintendence
of Abraham Ortelius; and so great was their excellence when compared
with former maps executed on wood, that the business of map engraving
was within a few years transferred almost exclusively to engravers on
copper. In 1572 a map engraved on copper was printed in England, in the
second edition of Archbishop Parker’s Bible. It is of folio size, and
the country represented is the Holy Land. Within an ornamented tablet is
the following inscription: “Graven bi Humfray Cole, goldsmith, an
English man born in y<sup>e</sup> north, and pertayning to y<sup>e</sup>
mint in the Tower. 1572.” In Walpole’s Catalogue of Engravers the
portraits engraved on copper of Queen Elizabeth, the Earl of Leicester,
and Lord Burleigh, which appear in the first edition of Archbishop
Parker’s Bible, 1568,<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI100" id = "tagVI100"
href = "#noteVI100">VI.100</a> are ascribed to Humphrey Cole, apparently
on no better ground than that his name appears as the engraver of the
map, which is given in the second. If Cole were really the engraver of
those portraits, he was certainly entitled to a more favourable notice<a
class = "tag" name = "tagVI101" id = "tagVI101" href =
"#noteVI101">VI.101</a> than he
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page420" id = "page420">
420</a></span>
receives from the fastidious compiler of the “Catalogue of Engravers who
have been born or resided in England;” for, considering <i>when</i> and
<i>where</i> they were executed, the engraver is entitled to rank at
least as high as George Vertue. In fact, the portrait of Leicester,
considered merely as a specimen of engraving, without regard to the time
and place of its execution, will bear a comparison with more than one of
the portraits engraved by Vertue upwards of a hundred and fifty years
later.</p>

<p>The advantages of copper-plate engraving for the purpose of executing
maps, as exemplified in the work of Ortelius, appear to have been
immediately appreciated in England, and this country is one of the first
that can boast of a collection of provincial or county maps engraved on
copper. A&nbsp;series of maps of all the counties of England and Wales,
and of the adjacent islands, were engraved, under the superintendence of
Christopher Saxton, between 1573 and 1579, and published at London, in a
folio volume, in the latter year. Though the greater number of those
maps were the work of Flemish engravers, eight, at least, were engraved
by two Englishmen, Augustine Ryther and Nicholas Reynolds.<a class =
"tag" name = "tagVI102" id = "tagVI102" href = "#noteVI102">VI.102</a>
They appear to have been all drawn by Christopher Saxton, who lived at
Tingley, near Leeds. Walpole says, that “he was servant to Thomas
Sekeford, Esq. Master of the Court of Wards,” the gentleman at whose
expense they were engraved. He also states that many of them were
engraved by Saxton himself; but this I consider to be extremely
doubtful. In his account of early English copper-plate engravers,
Walpole is frequently incorrect: he mentions Humphrey Lhuyd&mdash;an
author who wrote a short description of Britain, printed at Cologne in
1572<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI103" id = "tagVI103" href =
"#noteVI103">VI.103</a>&mdash;as the <i>engraver</i> of the map of
England in the collection of Ortelius; and he includes Dr. William
Cuningham, a&nbsp;physician of Norwich, in his catalogue of engravers,
without the slightest reason beyond the mere fact, that a book entitled
“The Cosmographical
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page421" id = "page421">
421</a></span>
Glasse,” written by the Doctor, and printed in 1559, contains several
<i>wood-cuts</i>. He might, with equal justice, have placed Archbishop
Parker in his catalogue, and asserted that some of the <i>plates</i> in
the Bible were “engraved by his own hand.”</p>

<p>In connexion with the preceding account of the earliest maps executed
in England on copper, it perhaps may not be unnecessary to briefly
notice here the introduction of copper-plate engraving into this
country. According to Herbert, in his edition of Ames’s Typographical
Antiquities, the frontispiece of a small work entitled “Galenus de
Temperamentis,” printed at Cambridge, 1521, is the earliest specimen of
copper-plate engraving that is to be found in any book printed in
England. The art, however, supposing that the plate was really engraved
and printed in this country, appears to have received no encouragement
on its first introduction, for after this first essay it seems to have
lain dormant for nearly twenty years. The next earliest specimens appear
in the first edition of a work usually called “Raynalde’s Birth of
Mankind,” printed at London in 1540.<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI104"
id = "tagVI104" href = "#noteVI104">VI.104</a> This work, which is a
treatise on the obstetric art, contains, when perfect, three plates,
illustrative of the subject. Not having had an opportunity of seeing any
one of these three plates nor the frontispiece to “Galenus de
Temperamentis,” I&nbsp;am obliged to trust to Herbert for the fact of
their being engraved on copper. In the third volume of his edition of
Ames, page 1411, there is a fac-simile of the frontispiece to the
Cambridge book; and in the Preliminary Disquisition on Early Engraving
and Ornamental Printing, prefixed to Dr. Dibdin’s edition of the
Typographical Antiquities, will be found a fac-simile, engraved on wood,
of one of the plates in Raynalde’s Birth of Mankind. In an edition of
the latter work, printed in 1565, the “byrthe figures” are not engraved
on copper, but on wood.</p>

<p>A work printed in London by John Hereford, 1545, contains several
unquestionable specimens of copper-plate engraving. It is of folio size,
and the title is as follows: “Compendiosa totius Anatomiæ delineatio ære
exarata, per Thomam Geminum.” The ornamental title-page, with the arms
of Henry VIII. towards the centre, is engraved on copper, and several
anatomical subjects are executed in the same manner.
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page422" id = "page422">
422</a></span>
Gemini, who is believed to have been the engraver of those plates, was
not a native of this country.<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI105" id =
"tagVI105" href = "#noteVI105">VI.105</a> In a dedication to Henry VIII,
he says that in his work he had followed Andrew Vesalius of Brussels;
and he further mentions that in the year before he had received orders
from the King to have the plates printed off [<i>excudendas</i>]. A
second edition, dedicated to Edward VI, appeared in 1553; and a third,
dedicated to Queen Elizabeth, in 1559.<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI106"
id = "tagVI106" href = "#noteVI106">VI.106</a> In the last edition the
Royal Arms on the title-page are effaced, and the portrait of Queen
Elizabeth engraved in their stead. Traces of the former subject are,
however, still visible, and the motto, “Dieu et mon Droit,” has been
allowed to remain. One of the engravings in this work affords a curious
instance of the original plate of copper having been either mended or
enlarged by joining another piece to it. Even in the first edition, the
zigzag line where the two pieces are joined, and the forms of the little
<i>cramps</i> which hold them together, are visible, and in the last
they are distinctly apparent.</p>

<p>The earliest portrait engraved on copper, printed singly, in this
country, and not as an illustration of a book, is that of Archbishop
Parker engraved by Remigius Hogenberg. It is a small print four and a
half inches high by three and a half wide. At the corners are the arms
of Canterbury, impaled with those of Parker; the archbishop’s arms
separately; a&nbsp;plain shield, with a cross and the letters <img class
= "middle" src = "images/illus_422.png" width = "8" height = "19" alt =
"IX">; and the arms of Archbishop Cranmer. The portrait is engraved in
an oval, round the border of which is the following inscription: “Mūdus
transit, et cupiscētia ejus. Anno Domini 1572, ætatis suæ Anno 69. Die
mensis Augusti sexto.” In an impression, now before me, from the
original plate, the date and the archbishop’s age are altered to 1573
and 70, but the marks of the ciphers erased are quite perceptible. The
portrait of the archbishop is a half-length; he is seated at a table, on
which are a bell, a&nbsp;small coffer, and what appears to be a stamp.
A&nbsp;Bible is lying open before him, and on one of the pages is
inscribed in very small letters the following passage from the <span
class = "smallroman">VI.</span> chapter of Micah, verse&nbsp;8:
“Indicabo tibi, o&nbsp;homo, quid sit bonum, et quid Deus requirat a te,
utique facere judicium, et diligere misericordiam, et solicitum ambulare
cum Deo tuo.” The engraver’s name, “<i>R.&nbsp;Berg f.</i>,” appears at
the bottom of the print to the right: a&nbsp;cross line from the R to
the B indicates the abbreviation of the surname, which, written at
length, was
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page423" id = "page423">

<i>Hogenberg</i>. Caulfield, speaking of this engraving in his
Calcographiana, page 4, 1814, says,&mdash;“The only impression supposed
to be extant is in the library at Lambeth Palace; but within the last
two years, Mr. Woodburn, of St. Martin’s Lane, purchased a magnificent
collection of portraits, among which was a very fine one of Parker.”</p>

<p>The number of books, containing copper-plate engravings, published in
England between 1559 and 1600, is extremely limited; and the following
list will perhaps be found to contain one or two more than have been
mentioned by preceding writers: 1.&nbsp;Pena and Lobel’s Stirpium
Adversaria Nova, folio, 1570,&mdash;ornamented title-page, with the arms
of England at the top, and a small map towards the bottom:&mdash;the
ornaments surrounding the map are very beautifully engraved.
2.&nbsp;Archbishop Parker’s Bible, 1568-1572, with the portraits,
previously noticed at page 419. 3.&nbsp;Saxton’s Maps, with the portrait
of Queen Elizabeth on the title, 1579. 4.&nbsp;Broughton’s Concent of
Scripture, 1591,&mdash;engraved title, and four other plates.
5.&nbsp;Translation of Ariosto by Sir John Harrington,
1591,&mdash;engraved title-page, containing portraits of the author and
translator, and forty-six other plates. 6.&nbsp;R. Haydock’s Translation
of Lomazzo’s Treatise on Painting and Architecture, Oxford,
1598,&mdash;engraved title-page, containing portraits of Lomazzo and
Haydock, and several very indifferent plates, chiefly of architecture
and figures in outline.</p>

<p>Walpole mentions a plate of the arms of Sir Christopher Hatton on the
title-page of the second part of Wagenar’s Mariner’s Mirrour, printed in
1588, and the plates in a work entitled “A&nbsp;True Report of the
Newfoundland of Virginia,” all engraved by Theodore de Bry. The first of
these works I have not been able to obtain a sight of;<a class = "tag"

though it appeared in 1591, it was printed at Frankfort. In the reigns
of James and Charles I, copper-plate engraving was warmly patronised in
England, and several foreign engravers, as in the reign of Elizabeth,
were induced to take up their abode in this country. In the first
edition of Chambers’ Cyclopedia, it is stated that the art of
copper-plate engraving was brought
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page424" id = "page424">
424</a></span>
to this country from Antwerp by Speed the historian,&mdash;an error
which is pointed out by Walpole: the writer it seems had not been aware
of any earlier copper-plates printed in England than Speed’s maps, which
were chiefly executed by Flemish engravers.</p>

speaking, for the engravings are all from wood-blocks. At the foot of

the mark I.&nbsp;B. F, which, from something like a tool for engraving,
between the B.&nbsp;and F in the original, is most likely that of the
engraver. The principal cut is a portrait of the author,

<p>It is much more likely that some of those cuts were engraved by the

the initials I.&nbsp;D. appear on a cut at the end of the book,&mdash;a
skeleton extended on a tomb, with a tree growing out of it&mdash;and
also on two or three of the large ornamental letters. John Day, in a

<p>Of all the books printed in England in the reigns of Queen Mary and
Queen Elizabeth, those from the press of John Day generally contain the
best executed wood-cuts; and even though he might not be the engraver of
the cuts which contain his initials, yet it cannot be doubted that he
possessed a much better taste in such matters than any other English
printer of his age. Some of the large ornamental letters in works
printed by him are much superior to anything of the kind that had
previously appeared in England. In the “Booke of Christian Prayers”
printed by John Daye 1569, which goes by the name of “Queen Elizabeth’s
Prayer Book,” there is a portrait of her Majesty, kneeling upon a superb
cushion, with elevated hands, in prayer, of which the

of considerable spirit and beauty, representing, among other things,
some of the subjects of Holbein’s Dance of Death.</p>

throne, attended by three persons, supposed to be intended for one

<p>Though it be beyond the plan of the present work to trace the
progress of the various kinds of large ornamental letters engraved on
wood that have been from time to time introduced by the principal
German, French, Italian, and English printers from the invention of
typography, it may not be unnecessary to say a few words on this
subject. In the earliest works of the German printers, as the type was a
close imitation of the handwriting of the period, as used in Bibles and
Missals, the large ornamental letters occasionally introduced are
distinguished by their flourishes and grotesque work extending on the
margin both above and below the body of the letter, as is frequently
seen in illumined manuscripts of the period. Large initial letters of
this kind are not
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page430" id = "page430">
430</a></span>
unfrequent in early French works; but are comparatively scarce in books
printed in England, where a letter, engraved on a square block,
appearing, with the ornaments, white on a black ground, was adopted
shortly after the introduction of printing by Caxton.<a class = "tag"
name = "tagVI112" id = "tagVI112" href = "#noteVI112">VI.112</a> As the
capitals of the Roman character used in Italy did not admit of the
flourishes which accorded so well with the curves of Gothic or German
capitals, the printers of that country, towards the end of the fifteenth
century, began to introduce flowers, figures of men, birds, and
quadrupeds, as back-grounds to their large initial letters. Between 1520
and 1530 this mode of ornamenting their large Roman letters was in great
repute with the printers of Basle, Geneva, and Zurich, and to this taste
we owe the small alphabet of the Dance of Death. Subsequently the
Italian wood engravers, employed by the printers, carried this style of
ornament a step further by introducing landscapes as well as figures to
form a back-ground to the letter. The following specimen of letter thus
ornamented is from a work printed by Giolito at Venice about 1550. The
large capitals, in Cuningham’s Cosmographical Glasse, were doubtless
suggested by Italian letters in the same taste.</p>

<p>The borders which appear in the title-pages of Italian books of this
period, and more especially in those printed at Venice, frequently
display considerable excellence both in design and execution. They are
generally much lighter and more varied in design than the borders in
German books; and cross-hatching, which is seldom seen in Italian
wood-cuts executed previous to 1520, is so frequently introduced that it
would seem that this mode of producing a certain effect&mdash;which
might often have been accomplished by simpler means&mdash;was then
considered as a proof of the engraver’s talent. Some of the Italian
printers’ marks and devices, on the title-page, or at the end of a work,
are drawn and engraved with great spirit. The following devices occur in
a folio
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page431" id = "page431">

edition of Dante&mdash;known to bibliographers as the <i>cat

<p>In the latter part of the sixteenth and the beginning of the
seventeenth century, an Italian artist named Andrea Andreani executed a
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page432" id = "page432">
432</a></span>
considerable number of chiaro-scuros on wood. He was born at Mantua in
1540, and one of his earliest and largest works in this style is dated
1586. The subject is the History of Abraham, from the pavement of the
cathedral of Siena;<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI114" id = "tagVI114"
href = "#noteVI114">VI.114</a> the first compartment consists of twelve
pieces, printed in three colours, forming, when joined together,
a&nbsp;large composition about five feet six inches wide by about two
feet six inches high. The second compartment, Moses breaking the Tables
of the Law, is not properly a chiaro-scuro, but a large wood-cut,
consisting of several pieces, printed in ink in the usual manner. It is
about six feet wide by about four feet high. Another large work of
Andreani’s is the Triumphs of Julius Cæsar, from the designs of Andrea
Mantegna, dedicated to Vincentius Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua, and published
in a folio volume in 1598. Andreani having obtained the blocks of
several of the chiaro-scuros executed by Ugo da Carpi, Antonio da
Trente, Nicholas da Vincenza, and others, reprinted them with the
addition of his own mark; and from this circumstance he frequently
obtains the credit of having engraved many pieces which were really
executed by his predecessors and superiors in the art. The chiaro-scuros
which he reprinted are generally superior to those pieces which were
engraved by himself from original designs, and in the execution of which
he had to depend on his own judgment and taste. He continued to engrave
in this manner till he was upwards of seventy years old, for there are
one or two subjects by him dated 1612. Bartsch says that he died in
1623, but observes that some writers place his death in 1626.</p>

<p>Henry Goltzius, a painter and engraver, born in 1558, near Venloo, in
Flanders, executed several chiaro-scuros, chiefly from his own designs.
The most of them are from three blocks; and among the best executed are
Hercules and Cacus, and four separate pieces representing the four
elements. Like most of the other productions of this artist, whether
paintings or copper-plate engravings, his chiaro-scuros are designed
with great spirit, though the action of the figures is frequently
extravagant. He imitated Michael Angelo, but not with success; he too
frequently mistakes violence of action for the expression of
intellectual grandeur, and displays the “contortions of the pythoness
without her inspiration.” The cut in the opposite page is a reduced copy
of the subject intended
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page433" id = "page433">
433</a></span>
to represent the element of water. In the original the impression is
from four blocks; one with the outlines and shaded parts black, as in
the copy here given; the other three communicating different tints of
sepia. Henry Goltzius died in 1617. His mark, an H combined with a G, is
seen at the bottom of the cut.</p>

<p>The cuts contained in a work on ancient and modern costume, printed
at Venice in 1590,<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI115" id = "tagVI115"
href = "#noteVI115">VI.115</a> are frequently described as having been
drawn by Titian and engraved by his <i>brother</i>, Cesare Vecellio.
That this person might have been a relation of Titian, whose family name
was Vecelli, is not unlikely, but it is highly improbable that he was
his brother; for
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page434" id = "page434">
434</a></span>
Titian died in 1576, aged ninety-nine, and the dedication of the work to
Pietro Montalbano by Cesare Vecellio is dated October, 1589. In the
title it is stated that the costumes in question were
“done”&mdash;<i>fatti</i>&mdash;by Vecellio himself; but whether this
word relates to the drawing or the engraving, or to both, it would be
exceedingly difficult to ascertain. Those cuts have the appearance of
having been drawn on the block with pen-and-ink; and some of the best
display so much “character” that they look like portraits of individuals
freely sketched by the hand of a master. It was first stated in an
edition of the work, printed in 1664, that the cuts were drawn by Titian
and engraved by Cesare Vecellio, his brother. The improbable assertion
was merely a bookseller’s trick to attract purchasers. It has also been
frequently asserted, that the cuts in Vesalius’s Anatomy, printed at
Basle in 1548, were drawn by Titian. The Abbé Morelli has, however,
shown that they were not drawn by him, but by John Calcar,
a&nbsp;Flemish painter, who had been one of his pupils.</p>

<p>Papillon, who in his desire to dignify his art claims almost every
eminent painter as a wood engraver, pretends that Titian executed
several large cuts from his own designs. He says that Titian began to
engrave on wood when he was twenty-five years old [in 1502], and he
mentions a cut of the Virgin and the infant Christ, with other
figures,&mdash;probably intended to represent the marriage of St.
Catherine,&mdash;as one of the earliest specimens of his talents as a
wood engraver. Papillon also informs us that Titian engraved a large cut
of the Triumph of Christ, or of Faith, in 1508; and in another part of
his work he describes several others as engraved by Titian himself.</p>

<p>Several of the cuts after designs by Titian, but which were certainly
not of his engraving, are of large size, and executed in a free, coarse
manner, as if they were rather intended to paste against a wall than to
be inserted in a portfolio. One of the largest is the destruction of
Pharaoh and his host; it consists of several pieces, which, when united,
form a complete subject about four and a half feet wide by about three
feet high. A&nbsp;dog, which the painter has introduced in a peculiar
attitude,<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI116" id = "tagVI116" href =
"#noteVI116">VI.116</a> gives to the whole the air of burlesque. The
person by whom it was engraved styles himself “depintore,” a&nbsp;word
perhaps intended to imply that he was a brother of the guild, or society
of painter-stainers, stencillers, and wood engravers.<a class = "tag"
name = "tagVI117" id = "tagVI117" href = "#noteVI117">VI.117</a> His
name, with the date, is engraved thus at the bottom of the cut, which is
one of those which Papillon says
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page435" id = "page435">
435</a></span>
were executed by Titian himself: “In Venetia p.&nbsp;dominico dalle
greche depintore venetiano. <span class =
"smallroman">M.DXLIX.</span>”</p>

<p>The following is a reduced copy of a cut designed by Titian, and said
to have been intended by him to ridicule those painters who, not being
able to succeed in colouring, recommended ancient sculptures, on account
of the correctness of the forms, as most deserving of a painter’s
diligent study. The subject is a caricature of the Laocoon; and the
professed admirers of antiquity, who, above all, insisted on correct
drawing, and thought slightly of colouring, are represented by the old
ape wanting a tail, seen in the distance, attended by three of her young
ones. The original cut is fifteen inches and seven-eighths wide by ten
inches and a half high. It is coarsely engraved, and contains neither
name nor date.<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI118" id = "tagVI118" href =

<p>Wood engraving in Germany at the close of the sixteenth century
appears to have greatly declined; the old race of artists who furnished
designs for the wood engraver had become extinct, and their places were
not supplied by others. The more expensive works were now illustrated
with copper-plates; and the wood-cuts which appeared in the commoner
kinds of books were in general very indifferent both in design and
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page436" id = "page436">
436</a></span>
execution. As Germany was the country in which wood engraving was first
encouraged and fostered, so was it also the country in which the art
earliest declined and subsequently became most thoroughly neglected. In
France and Italy, wood engraving had also by this time experienced a
considerable decline, but not to such an extent as in Germany.</p>

<p>Between 1590 and 1610, when the art was rapidly declining in other
countries, the wood-cuts which are to be met with in English books are
generally better executed than at any preceding period. Engraved
title-pages were then frequent, and several of them are executed with
considerable skill. A&nbsp;large wood-cut, with the date 1607, in
particular displays great merit both in design and engraving. The
following is a reduced copy of an impression preserved in the Print Room
of the British Museum.<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI119" id = "tagVI119"
href = "#noteVI119">VI.119</a> The original, exclusive of the verses,
and the ornaments at each side of them, is about fourteen inches high by
about fourteen and a half wide.</p>

<p>The following are the six concluding lines of the sonnet underneath
the cut: in the original they are printed in smaller type than the
others, and in a double column. In the copy they are merely indicated to
show the relative size of the type to that of the first eight lines.</p>

<div class = "verse">

<p class = "indent">Have quight worn out all ancient Hospitalitie.</p>
</div>

<p>The flowers at each side of the verses are, in the original, very
coarsely executed. They are merely printers’ ornaments, engraved
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page437" id = "page437">
437</a></span>
on separate pieces of wood, and not on the same block as the cut above
them.</p>

<p>From one or two worm-holes, which have been in the block when it was
printed in 1607, and which are apparent in the impression, it seems
probable that this cut had been engraved some time previous to the date
which appears at the bottom. As it is, however, very likely that the
block was of pear-tree, which is extremely liable to the attacks of the
worm, it is possible that it might have been injured in this manner
within a year or two of its being finished. The bold, <i>cleanly cut</i>
lines of the original are very much like the work of Christopher Jegher,
one of the best wood engravers of that period. He resided at Antwerp,
but he is said to have been born in Germany in 1578. His best works are
several large cuts which he engraved for Rubens from drawings made on
the block by Rubens himself, who appears to have originally
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page438" id = "page438">
438</a></span>
published them on his own account. From the manner in which the great
painter’s name is introduced at the bottom of each&mdash;“<i>P.&nbsp;P.
Rub. delin. &amp; excud.</i>”&mdash;it would appear that they were both
designed and printed by him. Impressions of those cuts sometimes occur
with a tint printed over them, in sepia, from a second block, in the
manner of chiaro-scuros. We here give a reduced copy of one of the
largest.<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI120" id = "tagVI120" href =

<p>As profit could not have been Rubens’s motive for having these cuts
engraved, it is not unlikely that his object was to compare his designs
when executed in this manner with those of the older German
masters&mdash;Durer, Burgmair, and Cranach. The best, however, differ
considerably in the manner of their execution from the best old German
wood-cuts, for the lines are too uniform and display too much of art; in
looking at those which consist chiefly of figures, attention is first
called to the <i>means</i> by which an effect is produced, rather than
to the effect itself in connexion with the entire subject. This
objection applies most forcibly to the cut which represents the Virgin
crowned by the Almighty and Jesus Christ. The design displays much of
Rubens’s grandeur, with not less of his extravagance in the attitude of
the figures; but he seems to have studied less the effect of the whole,
than to have endeavoured to express certain parts by a peculiar
arrangement of lines und hatchings. The subject does not produce that
feeling, which it is the great object of art to excite, in consequence
of the attention being diverted from the contemplation of the whole to
the means by which it is executed. In such impressions, however, as have
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page439" id = "page439">
439</a></span>
a tint of sepia printed over them from a second block, the hardness of
the lines and heaviness in the hatchings are less apparent. The
following is a reduced copy of another of those cuts, which, for the
beautiful simplicity of the design, is perhaps the most pleasing of the
whole. The execution of the original is, however, coarse, a&nbsp;defect
which is not so apparent in the copy in consequence of the small scale
on which it is engraved.<a class = "tag error" name = "tagVI121" id =

<p>Cornelius van Sichem,<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI122" id =
"tagVI122" href = "#noteVI122">VI.122</a> a contemporary of Christopher
Jegher, appears to have been one of the most industrious wood engravers
of his time. He was a native of Holland, and is supposed to have resided
at Amsterdam. One of his best cuts is a large head, engraved from a
drawing by Henry Goltzius, with the date 1607. This and several other
large cuts, which he probably engraved about the same time, are so much
superior to the smaller cuts, with his mark, which appear in books, that
I am inclined to think that most of the latter must have been engraved
by his pupils; they are indeed so numerous that it seems almost
impossible that he should have engraved them all himself. He seems at
first to have worked for fame, and afterwards to have turned a
manufacturer of wood-cuts for money. The cuts with his mark contained in
a quarto book entitled “Bibels Tresoor,” printed at Amsterdam
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page440" id = "page440">

in 1646, by no means afford an idea of his ability as a wood-engraver;
many of them are wretched copies of old wood-cuts designed by Albert
Durer and other old masters, discreditable alike to the engraver and to
the originals. The following is a slightly reduced copy of a cut,
engraved by Van Sichem, from a design by Henry Goltzius. The original,
which was probably engraved about 1607, may be considered as an average
specimen of the engraver’s talents; it is not so well executed as some
of his best large cuts, while it is much superior to the greater number
of the small cuts which contain his mark. The subject is Judith with the
head of Holofernes.</p>

<p>About 1625 a French wood engraver of the name of Businck executed
several chiaro-scuros chiefly from designs by Lalleman and Bloemart; and

himself “Romanus Eques,” practised the same art

it would seem that the designer was either a pupil of Rubens, or had
closely copied his manner. In Professor Christ’s Dictionary of Monograms
the mark <img class = "middle" src = "images/illus_441.png" width = "22"

and pupil of Valesius.” Papillon, Traité de la Gravure en Bois, tom.
i.&nbsp;p.&nbsp;274, adopting Professor Christ’s explanation of the
mark, mentions “Andrea Salmincio” as the designer of those cuts; but in
page 461 of the same volume, he says, referring to his former statement,
that he had since been informed by M.&nbsp;Eisen, a&nbsp;painter, and a
native of Valenciennes, that they were designed by “a&nbsp;famous
Flemish painter and engraver on wood, named Sallarte,
a&nbsp;contemporary of Rubens, and who is supposed to have assisted the
latter in some of his great works.” Those cuts may perhaps be considered
as the last series that were expressly designed by an artist of talent
in the seventeenth century, for the purpose of being engraved on wood.
The style in which they are executed is not worthy of the designs,
though, considering the period, they are not without merit. The engraver
appears to have been extremely partial to a kind of cross-hatching, in
which the interstices are more like squares than acute-angled lozenges,
thus giving to the figures and draperies a hard and unpliable
appearance.</p>

<p>Though several English wood engravings of the reigns of James&nbsp;I.
and Charles&nbsp;I. have evidently been executed by professed wood
engravers, yet a great proportion of those contained in English books
and pamphlets printed in this country during the seventeenth century
appear to have been the work of persons who had not learnt and did not
regularly practise the art. The cuts of those occasional wood engravers,
who were
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page442" id = "page442">
442</a></span>
most likely printers, are as rude in design as they are coarse in
execution, frequently displaying something like the fac-simile of a
boy’s drawing in his first attempts to sketch “the human <i>form</i>
divine.” Such cuts, evidently executed on the spur of the moment, are of
frequent occurrence in tracts and pamphlets published during the time of
the war between Charles&nbsp;I. and the Parliament. Evelyn, in the first
edition of his Sculptura, published in 1662, thus mentions Switzer as a
wood engraver of that period: “We have likewise Switzer for cutting in
wood, the son of a father<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI125" id =
"tagVI125" href = "#noteVI125">VI.125</a> who sufficiently discovered
his dexterity in the <i>Herbals</i> set forth by Mr. Parkinson, Lobel,
and divers other works.” The cuts of plants in the work, usually called
Lobel’s Botany, were most certainly not engraved by the elder Switzer;
they are much superior to the cuts of the same kind which are
undoubtedly of his engraving, and the work in which they first appeared
was printed in London in 1571. He engraved the cuts in Speed’s History
of Britain, folio, 1611; and, though the author calls him “the most
exquisite and curious hand of that age,” they abundantly testify that he
was a very ordinary workman. They are executed in a meagre, spiritless
manner; the best are those which represent the portraitures of the
ancient Britons. The cuts in Parkinson’s Paradisus Terrestris, folio,
1629, were also undoubtedly engraved by him; his name,
“<i>A.&nbsp;Switzer</i>,” with a graver underneath, occurs at the bottom
of the very indifferent cut which forms the title-page. The portrait of
the author is scarcely superior to the title-page; and the cuts of
plants are the most worthless that are to be found in any work of the
kind. It is not unlikely that the cuts in Topsell’s History of
Four-footed Beasts, 1607, and in Moffet’s Theatre of Insects, 1634, were
also engraved by the elder Switzer. The taste for wood-cuts must have
been low indeed when such an engraver was considered one of the best of
his age. Of the younger Switzer’s abilities I have had no means of
judging, never having seen a single cut which was known to be of his
engraving.</p>

<p>Between 1650 and 1700 wood engraving, as a means of multiplying
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page443" id = "page443">
443</a></span>
the designs of eminent artists, either as illustrations of books or as
separate cuts, may be considered as having reached its lowest ebb.
A&nbsp;few tolerably well executed cuts of ornaments are occasionally to
be found in Italian, French, and Dutch books of this period; but though
they sufficiently attest that the race <i>of workmen</i> was not wholly
extinct, they also afford ample proof that <i>artists</i> like those of
former times had ceased to furnish designs for the wood engraver. The
art of design was then, however, in a languishing condition throughout
Europe; and even supposing that wood engraving had been as much in
fashion as copper-plate printing then was for the purpose of
illustrating books, it would be vain to expect in wood-cuts that
excellence of composition and drawing which is not to be found in the
works of the best painters of the time. Wood engravings to please must
possess <i>some</i> merit in the design&mdash;must show some trait of
feeling for his subject on the part of the designer. Deficiency in this
respect can never be compensated by dexterity of execution: in anything
that approaches to fine art, mere workmanship, the result of laborious
application, can never atone for want of mind. The man who drew a
portrait of Queen Anne with a pen, and wrote the Psalms in the lines of
the face, and in the curls of the hair, in characters so small that it
required a glass to read them, does not rank with a Vandyke or a
Reynolds, nor even with a Lely or a Kneller. At the period of the
greatest decline of wood engraving, the want that was felt was not of
working engravers to execute cuts, but of talented artists to design
them.</p>

<p>The principal French wood engravers about the end of the seventeenth
century were: Peter Le Sueur,&mdash;born in 1636, died 1716; his two
sons, Peter and Vincent; John Papillon the elder&mdash;who died in 1710;
and his son, of the same name, who was born in 1661, and died in 1723.
Though John Michael Papillon, son of John Papillon the younger, and
author of the Traité de la Gravure en Bois, speaks highly of the talents
of the aforesaid members of the families of Le Sueur and Papillon as
wood engravers, yet, from his account of their productions, it would
seem that they were chiefly employed in engraving subjects which
scarcely allowed of any display of excellence either in design or
execution. Their fine works were ornamental letters, flowered vignettes,
and tail-pieces for the booksellers; while their staple productions
appear to have been blocks for card-makers and paper-stainers, with
patterns for embroiderers, lace-workers, and ribbon-manufacturers. In
the succeeding century, J.&nbsp;M. Papillon, grandson of the first John
Papillon, and Nicholas le Sueur, grandson of the elder Peter Le Sueur,
fully supported the character of their respective families as wood
engravers. Some account of their works will be given in the proper
place.</p>

<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page444" id = "page444">

<p>The tail-piece at the conclusion of this chapter will afford some
idea of the primitive style of the wood-cuts previously mentioned as
occurring in tracts and pamphlets printed in England during the civil
war. It is a fac-simile of a cut which originally appeared on the
title-page to the first known edition of Robin Hood’s Garland, printed
in 1670.<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI126" id = "tagVI126" href =
"#noteVI126">VI.126</a> The original block is now in the possession of
Mr. William Garret of Newcastle-on-Tyne, and was frequently used by the
late Mr. George Angus of that town, as it had also been by his
predecessors in the same business, to decorate the title-pages of the
penny histories and garlands, which they supplied in such abundance for
the winter-evenings’ entertainment of the good folks of Northumberland
and the “Bishoprick.” Mr. Douce, in the second volume of his
Illustrations of Shakspeare, also gives a fac-simile of this cut; and
the following is his explanation of the subject.</p>

<p>“Mr. Ritson has taken notice of an old wooden cut ‘preserved on the
title-page of a penny history (<i>Adam Bell, &amp;c.</i>), printed at
Newcastle in 1772,’ and which represents, in his opinion, a&nbsp;morris
dance, consisting of the following personages: 1.&nbsp;A bishop.
2.&nbsp;Robin Hood. 3.&nbsp;The potter or beggar. 4.&nbsp;Little John.
5.&nbsp;Friar Tuck. 6.&nbsp;Maid Marian. He remarks that the whole is
too rude to merit a copy, a&nbsp;position that is not meant to be
controverted; but it is necessary to introduce the cut in this place for
the purpose of correcting an error into which the above ingenious writer
has fallen. It is proper to mention that it originally appeared on the
title-page to the first known edition of Robin Hood’s Garland, printed
in 1670, 18mo. Now, this cut is certainly not the representation of a
morris dance, but merely of the principal characters belonging to the
Garland. These are Robin Hood, Little John, <i>Queen Catherine</i>, the
bishop, the <i>curtal frier</i>, (not Tuck,) and the beggar. Even though
it were admitted that Maid Marian and Friar Tuck were intended to be
given, it could not be maintained that either the bishop or the beggar
made part of a morris.”</p>

<p>To give more specimens of wood engraving when in its lowest state of
declension has not been thought necessary; for even at this period it
would not be difficult to produce cuts which in point of mere execution
are superior to many which appeared when the art was at its height. It
is sufficient to have stated that, towards the end of the seventeenth
century, wood engraving for the higher purposes of the art had sunk into
utter neglect; that the best productions of the
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page445" id = "page445">
445</a></span>
regular wood engravers of the period mostly consist of unmeaning
ornaments which neither excite feeling nor suggest a thought; and that
the wood-cuts which appear to have been engraved by persons not
instructed in the business partake generally of the character of the
following tail-piece. Having now brought down the history of the art of
wood engraving to the end of the seventeenth century, its revival in the
eighteenth, with some account of the works of Thomas Bewick and the
principal English wood engravers of his time, will form the subject of
the next chapter.</p>

Besides those above mentioned, there is said to have been a “Death’s
Dance” at the following places: in Hungerford’s Chapel, Salisbury
Cathedral; Hexham Church; at Fescamp in Normandy, carved in stone; at
Dresden; Leipsic; Annaberg; and Berne in Switzerland. The last, painted
on the walls of the cloisters of the Dominican friars, was the work of
Nicholas Emanuel Deutsch, previously mentioned at page 314. So early as
1560 this painting was destroyed in consequence of the cloisters being
pulled down to widen a street. There are two copies of it in
water-colours preserved at Berne. From one of them a series of
lithographic engravings has been made. An ample list of old paintings of
this subject will be found in Mr. Douce’s Dance of Death, chapters iii.
and iv, published by Pickering, 1833, and republished, with additions,
by H.&nbsp;G. Bohn, 1858.</p>

<p><a name = "noteVI2" id = "noteVI2" href = "#tagVI2">VI.2</a>
Mr. Douce says, “Macaber was not a German or any other poet, but a
nonentity.” He supposes that the name <i>Macaber</i> is only a slight
and obvious corruption of <i>Macarius</i>, a Saint who lived as a hermit
in Egypt, and of whom there is a story of his showing to three kings or
noblemen an emblem of mortality in the shape of three skeletons. “The
word <i>Macabre</i>,” observes Mr. Douce, “is found only in French
authorities; and the Saint’s name, which in the modern orthography is
<i>Macaire</i>, would in many ancient manuscripts be written
<i>Macabre</i> instead of <i>Macaure</i>, the letter <i>b</i> being
substituted for that of <i>u</i> from the caprice, ignorance, or
carelessness of transcribers.” Mr. Douce’s conjecture would have been
more feasible had he produced a single instance from any ancient
manuscript of the name having been written <i>Macabre</i> instead of
<i>Macaure</i> or <i>Macarius</i>. By a similar process of reasoning, it
would not be difficult to prove a hundred old writers and poets
non-entities. In the earliest French editions, the work is intitled “La
Danse Macabre;” and in a Parisian edition, “Per Magistrum Guidonem
Mercatorem pro Godefrido de Marnef,” folio, 1490, the title is as
follows: “Chorea ab eximio Macabro versibus Alemanicis edita, et à Petro
Desrey emendata.” This seems to prove that Peter Desrey knew something
of a person named Macaber who had written a description of the Dance in
German.</p>

All the persons introduced were of the size of life. Death, in only one
instance, was represented as a perfect skeleton, and that was in the
subject of the Doctor, whom he was supposed to address as follows:</p>

<div class = "verse blackletter">
<p>“Herr Doctor b’schaw die Anatomey</p>
<p>An mir, ob sie recht g’macht sey.”</p>
</div>

<p>It has been said that the Pope, the Emperor, and the King, were
intended respectively for portraits of Pope Felix V, the Emperor
Sigismund, and Albert II, his successor, as King of the Romans. This,
however, is merely a conjecture, and not a very probable one. Sigismund
died before the commencement of the plague which is said to have been
the occasion of the painting.</p>

<p>Der Ablass that mir gar wol lohnen</p>

Several characters are to be found in those Dances of Death which do not
occur in the Simulachres et Historiées Faces de la Mort of Lyons, 1538.
In the preface to the Emblems of Mortality,&mdash;with wood-cuts by John
Bewick, 1789,&mdash;written by John Sidney Hawkins, Esq., the following
list is given of the cuts in an edition of “La grande Danse de Macabre
des Hommes et Femmes,” 4to. printed at Troyes for John Garnier, but
without a date. “The Pope, Emperor, Cardinal, King, Legate, Duke,
Patriarch, Constable, Archbishop, Knight, Bishop, Squire, Abbot,
Bailiff, Astrologer, Burgess, Canon, Merchant, Schoolmaster, Man of
Arms, Chartreux, Serjeant, Monk, Usurer, Physician, Lover, Advocate,
Minstrel, Curate, Labourer, Proctor, Gaoler, Pilgrim, Shepherd,
Cordelier, Child, Clerk, Hermit, Adventurer, Fool. The women are the
Queen, Duchess, Regent’s Wife, Knight’s Wife, Abbess, Squire’s Wife,
Shepherdess, Cripple, Burgess’s Wife, Widow, Merchant’s Wife, Bailiff’s
Wife, Young Wife, Dainty Dame, Female Philosopher, New-married Wife,
Woman with Child, Old Maid, Female Cordelier, Chambermaid,
Intelligence-Woman, Hostess, Nurse, Prioress, Damsel, Country Girl, Old
Chambermaid, Huckstress, Strumpet, Nurse for Lying-in-Woman, Young Girl,
Religious, Sorceress, Bigot, Fool.” Nearly the same characters occur in
borders of the old Dutch Prayer Book mentioned at page 318, though in
the latter they are yet more numerous; among the men there is a
fowler&mdash;<i>vogelaer</i>&mdash;and among the women, the
beauty&mdash;<i>scone</i>&mdash;and the old woman&mdash;<i>alde
vrou</i>&mdash;which do not occur in the preceding list.</p>

<p><a name = "noteVI7" id = "noteVI7" href = "#tagVI7">VI.7</a>
It has been thought necessary to be thus particular in describing the
title-page of this rare edition, as it is incorrectly described by Mr.
Douce. In the copy in the British Museum the title-page is wanting.</p>

<p><a name = "noteVI8" id = "noteVI8" href = "#tagVI8">VI.8</a>
This “vray Zele” having said in the first page of the preface that the
name and surname of the revered abbess had the same sound as his own,
with the exception of the letter T, the editor of the Emblems
conjectures “that his name was <span class = "smallcaps">Jean</span>,
or, as it was anciently written, <span class = "smallcaps">Jehan de
Ouszell</span>, or <span class = "smallcaps">Ozell</span> as it is now
usually spelt.”</p>

<p><a name = "noteVI9" id = "noteVI9" href = "#tagVI9">VI.9</a>
In the original, “avancantes autāt les patronées jusques ici.” The word
<i>patronées</i>, I conceive to refer to cuts printed from wood-blocks.
The editor of the Emblems, 1688, who is followed by Mr. Ottley,
translated the passage, “exceeding all the <i>examples</i> hitherto.”
Works executed by means of a stencil were in old French said to be
<i>patronées</i>, and the word also appears to have been applied to
impressions printed from wood-blocks. The verb <i>patroner</i> is thus
explained in Noel and Chapsal’s Nouveau Dictionnaire de la Langue
Française, Paris, 1828: “Terme de cartier: enduire de couleur, au moyen
du patron évidé, les endroits où cette couleur doit paraître.”</p>

Mr. Douce supposes that the rainbow here alluded to was that which
appears in the cut of the Last Judgment, the last but one in the first
edition. The writer evidently means the natural rainbow which is mostly
seen imperfect.</p>

Traité de la Gravure en Bois, tom. i. p. 168. Papillon in a preceding
page had observed: “These cuts must have been engraved about 1530, for
we find the four first among the little figures of the Old Testament
printed in 1539, from which it is easy to perceive that many thousand
impressions had already been taken from the blocks.”&mdash;Those four
cuts in the first edition of the Dance of Death, have not the slightest
appearance of having been from blocks that had already furnished many
thousand impressions. In the copy now before me, I&nbsp;cannot perceive
a break or an imperfection in the most delicate lines. The first edition
of the “Historiarum Veteris Testamenti Icones,” to which Papillon
alludes, first appeared in the same year as the Simulachres, 1538, and
from the office of the same publishers, the brothers Melchior and Gaspar
Trechsel.</p>

Those cuts, with that of the astrologer and five others, supplied from a
later edition, were bought, at the sale of Mr. Ottley’s prints, in 1837,
for the British Museum, for £37 10<i>s.</i> In the catalogue, which,
I&nbsp;understand, was chiefly drawn up from his own memoranda, they are
thus described, under the head “<span class = "smallcaps">Hans
Holbein</span>,” No.&nbsp;458: “<span class = "smallcaps">The celebrated
Dance of Death</span>, first impressions, printed (probably at Basle,
about 1530,) upon one side only, with German titles at the top in type;
supposed to be <span class = "smallroman">UNIQUE</span>.” That they were
printed in 1530 is highly <i>improbable</i>, and they certainly are

Some copies have the title “Icones Mortis;” and though they correspond
in every other respect with those of the same year, intitled Imagines
Mortis, Mr. Douce seems to consider that this trifling variation is a
sufficient ground for describing them as different editions.</p>

Mr. Douce gives another amusing instance of Papillon’s sagacity in
assigning marks and names to their proper owners. “He (Papillon) had
seen an edition of the Emblems of Sambucus with cuts, bearing the mark
<img class = "middle" src = "images/illus_337a.png" width = "28" height
= "21" alt = "SA">, in which there is a fine portrait of the author with
his favourite dog, and under the latter the word <span class =
"smallcaps">Bombo</span>, which Papillon gravely states to be the name
of the engraver; and finding the same word on another of the emblems,
which has also the dog, he concludes that all the cuts which have not
the <img class = "middle" src = "images/illus_337a.png" width = "28"
height = "21" alt = "SA"> were engraved by the same <span class =

Mr. Douce, when correcting the mistake of the writer of the address,
commits an error himself. He says that “Death is in the act of
untwisting the <i>fastening to one of the hoops</i>.” Now, it is very
evident that he is undoing the rope or chain that steadies the cask and
confines it to the waggon. He has hold of the stake or piece of wood,
which serves as a <span class = "blackletter">twitch</span> to tighten
the rope or chain, in the manner in which large timber is secured to the
waggon in the present day.</p>

The words “<i>jà par luy trassées</i>” will apply more properly to
drawings already made on the block, but unengraved, than to unfinished
drawings on paper. It is indeed almost certain that the writer meant the
former, for their “<i>audacieux traicts, perspectives, et umbrages</i>”
are mentioned; they were moreover “<i>gracieusement deliniées</i>.”
These expressions will apply correctly to a finished, though unengraved
design on the block, but scarcely to an unfinished drawing on paper.</p>

I am very much inclined to think that Madame Jehanne de Touszele is a
fictitious character. I&nbsp;have had no opportunities of learning if
such a person were really abbess of the Convent of St. Peter at Lyons in

enquirer.</p>

Mechel’s work is in folio, with four subjects on each full page, and is
entitled “Oeuvre de Jean Holbein, ou Receuil de Gravures d’après ses
plus beaux ouvrages, &amp;c.&nbsp;Première Partie. La Triomphe de Mort.”
It is dedicated to George III, and the presentation copy is in the
King’s Library at the British Museum. The first part contains, besides
forty-five subjects of the Dance of Death, the design for the sheath of
a dagger from a drawing ascribed to Holbein, which has been re-engraved
in the work of Mr. Douce. It is extremely doubtful if the drawings of
the Dance, from which Mechel’s engravings are copied, be really by
Holbein. They were purchased by M.&nbsp;Fleischmann of Strasburg, at
Crozat’s sale at Paris in 1741. It was stated in the catalogue that they
had formed part of the Arundelian collection, and that they had
afterwards come into the possession of Jan Bockhorst, commonly called
Lang Jan, a&nbsp;contemporary of Vandyke. This piece of information,
however, can only be received as an auctioneer’s puff. M.&nbsp;Mechel
himself, according to Mr. Douce, had not been able to trace those
drawings previously to their falling into the hands of Monsieur Crozat.
They were purchased of M.&nbsp;Fleischmann by Prince Gallitzin,
a&nbsp;Russian nobleman, by whom they were lent to M.&nbsp;Mechel. They
are now in the Imperial Library at Petersburg. According to Mr. Coxe,
who saw them when in M.&nbsp;Mechel’s possession, they were drawn with a
pen, and slightly shaded with Indian ink. Hegner, in his Life of
Holbein, speaks slightingly of Mechel’s engravings, which he says were
executed by one of his workmen from copies of the pretended original
drawings made by an artist named Rudolph Schellenburg of Winterthur.
Those copper-plates certainly appear feeble when compared with the
wood-cut in the Lyons work, and Hegner’s criticism on the figure of Eve
seems just, though Mr. Douce does not approve of it. Hegner says, “Let
any one compare the figure of Eve under the tree in Mechel’s second
plate with the second wood-cut; in the former she is sitting in as
elegant an attitude as if she belonged to a French family by
Boucher.”&mdash;Boucher, a&nbsp;French painter, who died in 1770, was
famous in his time for the pretty women introduced into his
landscapes.</p>

<p><a name = "noteVI26" id = "noteVI26" href = "#tagVI26">VI.26</a>
Mr. Douce in every instance spells the name thus. In the proofs of the

“The identification of William Benting,” says Mr. Douce with exquisite
bon-hommie, “must be left to the sagacity of others. He <i>could not
have been</i> the Earl of Portland created in 1689, or he would have
been addressed accordingly. He is, moreover, described as a youth born
at Whitehall, and then residing there, and whose dwelling consisted of
nearly the whole of the palace that remained after the
fire.”&mdash;Dance of Death, p.&nbsp;244. It appears that these
addresses of Piccard were written in a foreign language, though, whether
Dutch, French, German, or Latin, Mr. Douce most unaccountably neglects
to say: he merely mentions that his extracts are translated.</p>

Hegner, in his Life of Holbein, speaking of the Nieuhoff discovery,
says: “Of this fable no notice would have been taken here had not Mr.
Douce ascribed undeserved authority to it, and had not his superficial
investigations found undeserved credit with English and other

Mr. Douce, at page 240 of his Dance of Death, complains of Hegner’s want
of urbanity and politeness; and in return calls his account of Holbein’s
works <i>superficial</i>, and moreover says that “his arguments, if
worthy of the name, are, generally speaking, of a most weak and flimsy
texture.” He also gives him a sharp rebuff by alluding to him as the
“above <i>gentleman</i>,” the last word, to give it point, being printed
in Italics. Mr. Douce, when he was thus pelting Hegner, does not seem to
have been aware that his own anti-Holbenian superstructure was a house
of glass.</p>

Evelyn is only referred to here on account of his <i>silence</i> with
respect to the pretended painting at Whitehall. What he says of Holbein
cannot be relied on, as will be seen from the following passage, which
is a fair specimen of his general knowledge and accuracy. “We have seen
some few things cut in wood by the incomparable Hans Holbein the Dane,
but they are rare and exceedingly difficult to come by; as his
<i>Licentiousness of the Friars and Nuns</i>; <i>Erasmus</i>; <i>The
Dance Macchabre</i>; the <i>Mortis Imago</i>, which he painted in great
in the Church of Basil, and afterwards graved with no less
art.”&mdash;Evelyn’s Sculpture, p.&nbsp;69. Edition 1769.</p>

occurs is “Partitiones Theologicæ, Pandectarum Universalium Conradi

A copy of this edition is preserved in the Public Library at Basle, and
there is another copy in the Royal Collection at Dresden. Another
edition, in every respect similar to the first, was also printed by the
brothers Trechsel in 1539. Hegner, in his Life of Holbein, does not seem
to have known of this edition; speaking of that of 1538, he says, “It is
probably the same as that to which Papillon gives the date 1539.” There
is a copy of the edition of 1539 in the British Museum.</p>

“A comparison of the 8th subject of the Simulachres,” says Mr. Douce,
“with that of the Bible for Esther <span class = "smallroman">I</span>,
<span class = "smallroman">II</span>, where the canopy ornamented with
fleurs-de-lis is the same in both, will contribute to strengthen the
above conjecture, as will both the cuts to demonstrate their Gallic
origin. It is most certain that the King sitting at table in the
Simulachres is intended for Francis I, which if any one should doubt,
let him look upon the miniature of that king, copied at p.&nbsp;214, in
Clarke’s ‘Repertorium Bibliographicum.’” The “above conjecture” referred
to in this extract is that previously cited at page 367, where Mr. Douce
conjectures that Holbein <i>might have been</i> employed to complete the
Bible cuts which <i>might have been</i> left unfinished in consequence
of the death of Mr. Douce’s “great unknown” designer of the Dance of
Death.&mdash;Dance of Death, p.&nbsp;96. Mr. Douce, not being able to
deny the similarity of many of the cuts, says it is highly probable that
Holbein was merely employed to finish the Bible cuts, without ever
considering that it is <i>primâ facie</i> much more probable that
Holbein was the designer of the cuts in both works.</p>

Dr. Dibdin, in his Bibliographical Tour vol. iii. pp. 80, 81, Edit.
1829, mentions two paintings at Augsburg by the elder Holbein, one dated
1499 and the other 1501. The elder Holbein had a brother named
Sigismund, who was also a painter, and who appears to have established
himself at Berne. Papillon, in his usual manner, makes Sigismund Holbein
a wood engraver. By his will, dated 1540, he appoints his nephew Hans
the heir of all his property in Berne.</p>

Patin’s edition of this work was published in octavo, at Basle, in 1676.
It contains eighty-three copper-plate engravings, from pen-and-ink
sketches, drawn by Holbein, in the margin of a copy of an edition
printed by Frobenius, in 1514, and still preserved (1860) in the Public
Library at Basle. It is said that Erasmus, when looking over those
sketches, exclaimed, when he came to that intended for himself, “Oho, if
Erasmus were now as he appears here, he would certainly take a wife.”
Above another of the sketches, representing a man with one of his arms
about a woman’s neck, and at the same time drinking out of a bottle,
Erasmus is said to have written the name “<i>Holbein.</i>” In an edition
of the Laus Stultitiæ, edited by G.&nbsp;G. Becker, Basle, 1780, 8vo.
those sketches are engraved (very indifferently) on wood.</p>

It is impossible to exceed the beauty and skill that are manifested in
this fine piece of art. The figures are, a&nbsp;king, queen, and a
warrior; a&nbsp;young woman, a&nbsp;monk, and an infant; all of whom
most unwillingly accompany Death in the Dance. The despair of the king,
the dejection of the queen, accompanied by her little dog, the terror of
the soldier who hears the drum of Death, the struggling of the female,
the reluctance of the monk, and the sorrow of the poor infant, are
depicted with equal spirit and veracity. The original drawing is in the
public library at Basle, and ascribed to Holbein.</p>

Erasmus, writing to Bilibald Pirkheimer, in 1524, says, “Rursus nuper
misi in Angliam Erasmum bis pictum ab artifice satis eleganti.” Hegner
thinks that this artist was Holbein. In 1517 a portrait of Erasmus, with
that of his friend Petrus Aegidius, was painted at Antwerp by Quintin
Matsys. It was intended by Erasmus as a present to Sir Thomas More. This
painting came subsequently into the possession of Dr. Mead, at whose
sale it was purchased, as the production of Holbein, by Lord Radnor, for
£110.</p>

Erasmus, in a letter to Sir Thomas More, written from Freyburg in
Brisgau, 5th September, 1529, alludes to a picture of More and his
family which had been brought over by Holbein; and Margaret Roper, the
eldest daughter of Sir Thomas More, writing to Erasmus in the following
November, says, that she is pleased to hear of the painter’s arrival
with the family picture,&mdash;“utriusque mei parentis nostrumque omnium
effigiem depictam.” Hegner thinks that those portraits of Sir Thomas
More and his family was only a drawing in pen-and-ink, which is now in
the Public Library at Basle. The figures in this drawing are: Sir Thomas
and his wife, his father, his son, and a young lady, three daughters,
a&nbsp;servant, and Sir Thomas’s jester. Over and under the figures are
written the name and age of each. The drawing is free and light; and the
faces and hands are very distinctly expressed.&mdash;Hans Holbein der
Jüngere, S.&nbsp;202-235-237. The drawing in the Public Library at Basle
was probably a sketch of Holbein’s large picture of the family of Sir
Thomas More.</p>

<p><a name = "noteVI57" id = "noteVI57" href = "#tagVI57">VI.57</a>
Holbein’s wife and <i>child</i> only, not children, are mentioned in
this licence. It is not known what became of Holbein’s children, as
there are no traces of his descendants to be found at Basle. Merian,
a&nbsp;clergyman of Basle, in a letter to Mechel on this subject, in
1779, writes to this effect: “According to a pedigree of the Merian
family, printed at Regensburg in 1727, Christina Syf, daughter of
Rodolph Syf and Judith Weissin, and grand-daughter of Hans Holbein the
unequalled painter, (born 1597,) was married on the 17th of November
1616 to Frederick Merian.” Perhaps it is meant that Judith Weissin was
Holbein’s grand-daughter: there is evidently an error in the pedigree;
and if it be wrong in this respect, it is not entitled to much credit in
another.</p>

Those designs were engraved on sixteen small plates by Hollar, but
without his name. The enemies of Christ are represented in the dress of
monks and friars, and instead of weapons they bear croziers, large
candlesticks, and other church ornaments; Judas appears as a capucin,
Annas as a cardinal, and Caiaphas as a bishop. In the subject of
Christ’s Descent to Hades, the gates are hung with papal bulls and
dispensations; above them are the Pope’s arms, and the devil as keeper
of the gate wears a triple crown. Underneath this engraving are the
following verses, which are certainly not of the period of Holbein:</p>

in German: “<i>Wer wider die Römischen, der soll

The following is the title of this scarce little volume. “Catechismus,

Canterbury, primate of all Englande and Metropolitane.&mdash;Gualterus

with a child before him, is the colophon: “Imprynted at London, in
S.&nbsp;Jhones Streete, by Nycolas Hyll, for Gwalter Lynne dwellyng on
Somers kaye, by Byllynges gate.” Mr. Douce, at page 96, mentions a cut
with the name <i>Hans Holbein</i> at the bottom, as occurring in the
title-page of “A&nbsp;lytle treatise after the manner of an Epystle

Mr. Douce, in his observations prefixed to Hollar’s etchings of the
Dance of Death, published by Edwards in 1794, says, “A&nbsp;<i>set</i>
of cuts with the latter mark [<i>Hans Holben</i>] occurs in Archbishop
Cranmer’s Catechism, printed by Walter Lyne, in 1548;” and in the same
page he commits another mistake by describing the mark on the cut of the
Duchess in the Lyons Dance of Death as <img class = "middle" src =
"images/illus_441.png" width = "22" height = "22" alt = "HB">, instead
of <img class = "middle" src = "images/illus_381b.png" width = "28"
height = "20" alt = "HL">. It has been considered necessary to notice
these errors, as it is probable that many persons who possess the work
in which they occur, but who never may have seen a copy of the Lyons
Dance of Death, nor of Cranmer’s Catechism, may have been misled in
those matters by implicitly relying on Mr. Douce’s authority.
A&nbsp;certain class of compilers are also extremely liable to transmit

title-page are extremely rare. Some copies have a modern lithographed
title prefixed, which is not exactly correct, though professedly a
fac-simile: in one of the scrolls it has “<i>telius meus</i>” for
“filius meus.” In the corresponding scroll in a copy in the British
Museum the words are in English: “This is my deare Son in whom I delyte,
heare him,”&mdash;above the figure of Christ with the banner of the

Porta “was a pupil of <i>Cecchino</i> Salviati, who is not to be
confounded with <i>Francesco</i> Salviati;” and yet in his Idée
Générale, published subsequently, page 134, we find “Francesco del
Salviati, autrement Rossi, de Florence, et son disciple Giuseppe Porta,
appellé communément Giuseppe Salviati.” Heineken, in his first work,
committed the mistake of supposing that Francesco Salviati’s to-name was
the Christian name of another person. In Huber’s Notice Générale des
Graveurs et Peintres, Francis Salviati appears as “François Cecchini,
dit Salviati.”</p>

The first forty-six cuts are the best, generally, both in design and
execution. The others, commencing at page 108, are illustrative of the
sayings and doctrines of ancient philosophers and moralists, and one or
two of the cuts are repeated. In this portion of the work, each page,
except what is occupied by the cut, is filled with explanatory or
illustrative verses arranged in triplets.</p>

The place which he did not think proper to name was undoubtedly Asculum,

Augustus.</p>

“est fort belle, excepté qu’elle manque de clair obscur, parce que les
tailles sont presque toutes de la même teinte, ce qui fait que les

Hans Sachs, whose poetical works might vie in quantity with those of
Lope Vega, was born at Nuremberg in 1494. Notwithstanding the immense
number of verses which he composed, he did not trust to his profession
of Meistersänger for the means of living, but continued to carry on his
business as a shoemaker till his death, which happened in 1576. His
verses were much admired by his contemporaries; and between 1570 and
1579, a&nbsp;collection of his works was published in five volumes
folio. Several short pieces by him were originally printed as
“broadsides,” with an ornamental or illustrative cut at the top.</p>

This work is entitled “Kunstbüchlein,” and consists entirely of cuts
without any explanatory letter-press. The first cut consists of a group
of heads, drawn and engraved with great spirit. On what appears
something like a slab of stone or wood&mdash;most unmeaningly and
awkwardly introduced&mdash;are Jost Amman’s initials, I.A., towards the
top, and lower down the mark, <img class = "middle" src =
"images/illus_412.png" width = "36" height = "20" alt = "MF"> which is
doubtless that of the engraver. This mark, with a figure of a graver
underneath, occurs on several of the other cuts. The three following
marks, with a graver underneath each, also occur: L.&nbsp;F.
C.S.&nbsp;G. H.&nbsp;These facts are sufficient to prove that Jost Amman
was not the engraver of the cuts which he designed. In the edition of
1599 the cuts are said to have been <i>drawn</i> by “the late most

In Professor Christ’s Dictionary of Monograms this mark is ascribed,
though doubtfully, to “Manuel Deutsch.” It is certainly not the mark of
Nicholas Emanuel Deutsch of Bern, for he died several years before 1548,
the date on several of the cuts with the mark H.R.&nbsp;M.D.&nbsp;in
Munster’s Cosmography, and which date evidently relates to the year in
which the artist made the drawing. There can be no doubt that those four
letters belong to a single name, for some of the cuts in which they
occur also contain the mark of an engraver.</p>

According to this method, certain words, together with radices and
terminations of frequent occurrence, were cast entire, and not in
separate letters, and placed in cases in such an order that the
compositor could as “readily possess himself of the Type of a word as of
the Type of a single letter.” This method, for which a patent was
obtained, is explained in a pamphlet entitled “An Introduction to
Logography: or the Art of Arranging and Composing for Printing with
Words entire, their Radices and Terminations, instead of single Letters.
By Henry Johnson: London, printed Logographically, and sold by
J.&nbsp;Walter, bookseller, Charing Cross, and J.&nbsp;Sewell, Cornhill,
<span class = "smallroman">M.DCC.LXXXIII.</span>” Several works were
printed in this manner, and among others an edition of Anderson’s
History of Commerce, 4&nbsp;vols. 4to. 1787-1789, by John Walter, at the
Logographic Press, Printing-House-Square, Blackfriars. Logography has
long been abandoned. The following account of this art is given in
H.&nbsp;G. Bohn’s Lecture on Printing, pp. 88, 89. “Something akin to
stereotyping is another mode of printing called Logography, invented by
the late Mr. Walter, of the <i>Times</i>, in 1783, and for which he took
out a patent. This means a system of printing from type cast in words
instead of single letters, which it was thought would save time and
corrections when applied to newspapers, but it was not found to answer.
A&nbsp;joke of the time was a supposed order to the typefounder for some
words of frequent occurrence, which ran thus:&mdash;‘Please send me a
hundred-weight, sorted, of murder, fire, dreadful robbery, atrocious
outrage, fearful calamity, alarming explosion, melancholy accident; an
assortment of honourable member, whig, tory, hot, cold, wet, dry;
half-a-hundred weight, made up in pounds, of butter, cheese, beef,
mutton, tripe, mustard, soap, rain, &amp;c.; and a few devils, angels,
women, groans, hisses, &amp;c.’ This method of printing did not succeed:
for if twenty-four letters will give six hundred sextillions of
combinations, no printing office could keep a sufficient assortment of
even popular words.”</p>

This mark, which occurs in two other cuts of large letters in the

in Robert Record’s Castle of Knowledge, folio, printed at London, by
Reginald Wolfe, 1556. This work, like that of Cuningham, is a treatise
on Geography. A&nbsp;mark, I.&nbsp;C., with a graver between the
letters, occurs frequently in cuts which ornament the margins of a work
entitled “A&nbsp;Book of Christian Prayers,” &amp;c. 4to. first printed
by John Day in 1569. It is usually called “Queen Elizabeth’s Prayer
Book.” In Herbert’s edition of the Typographical Antiquities it is
erroneously stated that such of the cuts as relate to the History of
Christ are “after Albert Durer and his wife, <i>Agnes Frey</i>.” They
are <i>not</i> copied from any cuts designed by Albert Durer, and his
wife most certainly neither drew nor engraved on wood. It is also
incorrectly stated “that a Dance of Death, in the same work, is after
Hans Holbein.”&mdash;The cuts in this work are very unequal in point of
execution. The best are those of the Senses&mdash;without any

“The pavement of this cathedral is the work of a succession of artists
from Duccio down to Meccarino, who have produced the effect of the
richest mosaic, merely by inserting grey marble into white, and hatching
both with black mastic. The grandest composition is the History of
Abraham, a&nbsp;figure which is unfortunately multiplied in the same
compartments; but, when grasping the knife, the patriarch is truly
sublime. These works lay exposed at least for a hundred years to the
general tread, and have been rather improved than defaced by the
attrition; for one female figure which had never been trodden looks
harsher than the rest. Those of the choir were opportunely covered two
centuries ago.”&mdash;Forsyth’s Italy, p.&nbsp;102, 2nd Edit.</p>

The following is the title of this work, which is a large octavo: “De
gli Habiti Antichi et Moderni di diverse Parti del Mondo Libri due,
fatti da Caesare Vecellio, &amp; con Discorsi da lui dichiriati. In
Venetia, <span class = "smallroman">MD.XC.</span>” This work is thus
mentioned in the notes to Rogers’s Italy: “Among the Habiti Antichi, in
that admirable book of wood-cuts ascribed to Titian, (A.&nbsp;D. 1590,)
there is one entitled Sposa Venetiana à Castello. It was taken from an
old painting in the Scuola di S.&nbsp;Giovanni Evangelista, and by the
writer is believed to represent one of the brides here
described.”&mdash;Italy, p.&nbsp;257, note. Edit. 1830.</p>

I have seen a large head, which at first sight might be mistaken for an
impression from a wood-block, executed by means of a stencil after a
design of Correggio. It was unquestionably old, and was about three feet
high by two and a half wide.</p>

The following is Papillon’s description of this cut: “Une Estampe que je
possede, et que l’on regarde assez indifférement, est le Laocoon gravé
en bois par le Titien, représenté sous la figure d’un singe et ses deux
petits entourés de serpens. Il fit ce morceau pour railler les Peintres
de son temps qui étudoient cette figure et les Statues antiques; et il
prétendit démontrer par cette Estampe qu’ils ressembloient aux singes,
lesquels ne font qu’imiter ce qu’ils voyent, sans rien inventer d’eux
mêmes.”&mdash;Traité de la Gravure en Bois, tom.

There is also in the Print Room of the British Museum a curious
wood-cut, of large size, engraved on several blocks, apparently of the
time of James&nbsp;I. The title at the top, in Latin and English, is as
follows: “<span class = "smallcaps">Humanæ vitæ imago olim ab Apelle in
tabula quadam depicta</span>. The image of the lyfe of man that was
painted in a table by Apelles.” The subject, however, is not so much a
general representation of the life of man in its several stages, as an
allegorical representation of the evils attendant on sensual indulgence.
Several of the figures are designed with great spirit, and the
explanations underneath the principal are engraved on the same block, in
Latin and English. It seems likely that this cut was engraved for the
purpose of being pasted or hung against a wall. It is about five feet
four inches wide by about three feet high. Some of the figures are
engraved with considerable spirit, but the groups want that
well-contrasted light and shade which give such effect to the large cuts
of Durer and Burgmair. It is likely that large cuts of this kind were
intended to be pasted on the walls of rooms, to serve at once for
instruction and ornament, like “King Charles’s Golden Rules and the
Royal Game of Goose” in later times.&mdash;<i>To this note Mr. Jackson
adds in his annotated copy</i>: “The drawing appears to have been
executed by an artist who was rather partial to cross-hatching, and the
engraving by one who knew how to render every line before him with a
degree of sharpness and delicacy by no means common at that period.”</p>

inches high.</p>

The original is eighteen inches wide by thirteen inches and a half high,

engraved on the same block.</p>

Papillon, tom. i. p. 274-276, calls this engraver <i>C.&nbsp;S.
Vichem</i>; and charges Professor Christ with confounding three
<i>Sichems</i> with three <i>Vichems</i>. The name at the bottom of the
cut, in the following page, is most certainly intended for <i>C.&nbsp;V.
Sichem</i>.</p>

The only perfect copy which I have seen of this little work is in
Spanish. The title is as follows: “La Perpetua Cruz, o&nbsp;Passion de
Jesu Christo Nuestro Señor, desde el principio de su encarnacion hasta
su muerte. Representada en quarenta estampas que se reparten de balde,
y&nbsp;explicada con differentes razones y oraciones de devocion. En
Amberes, en la emprenta de Cornelio Woons, 1650.” The cuts were engraved
at the instance of the Archbishop of Malines. Before the Spanish edition
appeared, thirty thousand copies of the work in Flemish and Latin had
already been circulated.</p>

In Walpole’s Catalogue of Engravers there is the following notice of the
elder Switzer: “In the Harleian Library was a set of wooden cuts,
representing the broad seals of England from the conquest to
James&nbsp;I. inclusive, neatly executed. Vertue says this was the sole
impression he had seen, and believed that they were cut by Chr. Switzer,
and that these plates were copied by Hollar for Sandford. Switzer also
cut the coins and seals in Speed’s History of Britain, 1614 [1611], from
the originals in the Cottonian Collection. Speed calls him <i>the most
exquisite and curious hand of that age</i>. He probably engraved the
botanic figures for Lobel’s Observations, and the plates [cuts] for
Parkinson’s Paradisus Terrestris, 1629. Chr. Switzer’s works have
sometimes been confounded with his son’s, who was of both his
names.”&mdash;Catalogue of Engravers, p.&nbsp;18 note, Edit. 1794. It is
doubtful if the elder Switzer’s Christian name were Christopher. The
initial in Parkinson’s Paradisus Terrestris is an A.&nbsp;It is,
however, possible that this letter may be intended for a Latin
preposition, and not for the first letter of the engraver’s Christian
name.</p>

The cuts in an edition of “The most Delightful History of Reynard the
Fox,” 4to. London, printed for Thomas Passinger, 1681, are scarcely
superior to this cut in point of execution, though it must be confessed
that the figures are generally in better “keeping.”</p>
