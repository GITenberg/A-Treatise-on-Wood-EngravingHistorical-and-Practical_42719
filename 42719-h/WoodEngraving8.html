<h3><a name = "chap_VIII" id = "chap_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</a><br>
<span class = "subhead">ARTISTS AND ENGRAVERS ON WOOD OF THE PRESENT
DAY.</span></h3>


<p><span class = "smallcaps">The</span> present chapter, which is
additional to the former edition, had not been contemplated until the
previous pages were printed off. But it was then suggested to the
publisher, by one who was able and willing to co-operate in the object,
that although the book was intended to be merely an improved reprint of
what had been given before, a&nbsp;short chapter might advantageously be
added respecting those Artists of the present day who were omitted by
Jackson, or have risen to eminence since his time.</p>

<p>Applications in the form of a circular were accordingly issued, and
have resulted in the Specimens now presented. They must speak for
themselves, it not being within the province of the publisher to
pronounce as to their respective merits. Besides which, the art of
wood-engraving, owing to the enormous impulse given to it during the
last twenty years, has attained such a pitch of excellence, that it
would be somewhat difficult to determine who, if sufficiently
stimulated, could produce the most perfect work. Artists in Wood, like
Artists in Oil, have their specialties, and excel relatively in
Landscape, Cattle, or Figure drawing; Architecture, Natural History,
Diagrams, or Humour. But though each may acquire distinction in the
department which choice or accident has assigned him, some can undertake
all departments equally well. In saying this we refer to engraving
rather than designing, for Harrison Weir would hardly undertake
Architecture; Orlando Jewitt, Animals; or George Cruikshank,
Mathematical Diagrams.</p>

<p>When, with the age of Bewick, wood-engraving began to reassume its
importance for book illustration, both designing and engraving were
generally performed by the same hand; but, in the present day, the
professions are becoming too important to be joined, and those who, like
William Harvey, Samuel Williams, and others, commenced by practising
both, now, recognising the modern policy of a division of labour,
confine themselves with few exceptions to one. Our business here, so far
as designs are concerned, is almost limited to those draughtsmen who
habitually draw on wood, for it is unnecessary to say that every drawing
or painting may be transferred to wood by the practical operator.</p>

<p>The following Specimens are given in accidental order rather than
with any notion of precedence or classification.</p>

<p>The present and following specimens are engraved by <span class =

illustrated edition of Childe Harold, published in 1859, which contains
eighty engravings, all designed by Mr. Percival Skelton; the others from
the Select Poems and Songs of Robert Burns, published by Kent &amp; Co.
in 1858. Mr. Cooper is favourably known to the artistic world by his
engravings in Rhymes and Roundelayes, a&nbsp;volume to which we shall
presently refer again; Poetry and Pictures from Thomas Moore, Longmans,
1858; The Merrie Days of England, 1859; Favourite English Poems, 1858;
and Bloomfield’s Farmer’s Boy, 1858&mdash;mostly after designs by Birket
Foster, and all produced under the superintendence of Mr. Joseph
Cundall.</p>

Landells, who, discerning his artistic talent, employed him from an
early age in the superior department of his profession. After he
commenced on his own account, his first important illustrations were for
Longfellow’s Poetical Works, of which the above is a specimen. He has
since partly or wholly illustrated, besides those works already
mentioned under the name of the engraver, Adams’s Allegories, published
by Messrs. Rivington; The Book of Favourite Modern Ballads, Poets of the
Nineteenth Century, Christmas with the Poets, Favourite English Poems,
Home Affections, The Merrie Days of England, Barry Cornwall’s Dramatic
Scenes and Poems, Southey’s Life of Nelson, Gosse’s Rivers of the Bible,
and many other of the best works of the period. In 1859 he was elected a
member of the Old Water Colour Society, and has since then devoted
himself almost exclusively, and with great success, to painting in Water
Colours.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Mr. John Tenniel</span> is a successful
illustrator of Historical subjects, and Ballad poetry, and has produced
many fine examples of his pencil. His most recent work is a series of
sixty-nine designs for the illustrated edition of Moore’s Lalla Rookh,
engraved by the Messrs. Dalziel, which the “Times” of Nov. 1, 1860,
calls the “greatest illustrative achievement of any single hand,” and of
which we here present an example. He is now engaged in illustrating
Shirley Brooks’ story called The Silver Cord, in “Once a Week;” and in
1857 he contributed a number of spirited designs to the illustrated
edition of Barry Cornwall’s Poetical Works. Among Mr. Tenniel’s earlier
works are several in the Book of British Ballads, edited by Samuel
Carter Hall, in 1843; and among his popular designs, sketched with a
free pencil, are his large cuts in “Punch,” and his small ones in
Punch’s Pocket Book.</p>

Messrs. Dalziel are among the most extensive of our wood-engravers, and
have taken part in all the illustrated works of importance which have
been produced during the last twenty years. Among the recent ones
are:&mdash;Staunton’s Illustrated Shakspeare, from which the above
specimen is taken, and Longfellow’s Poems, Routledge, 1859; Barry
Cornwall’s Dramatic Scenes and Poems, with fifty-seven wood-engravings,
published by Chapman and Hall in 1857, now republished by Henry
G.&nbsp;Bohn; and Tennyson’s Princess, after drawings by Maclise. These
artists are at present engaged in engraving Millais’ Designs in the
“Cornhill Magazine.”</p>

We have here, engraved by <span class = "smallcaps">Mr. W. A.
Folkard</span>, another of the early designs of <span class =
"smallcaps">Mr. John Gilbert</span>. It is one of the illustrations to
the Book of English Ballads, edited by S.&nbsp;C. Hall, in 1843, which
contains upwards of four hundred wood-engravings, and was the first work
of any consequence that presented a combination of the best artists of
the time. Indeed, it was the leader in what may be called the
Illustrated Christmas Books of the present day. Since this period, Mr.
Gilbert has probably produced more drawings on wood than any other
artist, and has contributed to almost every illustrated book of any
importance. He is a member of the Old Water Colour Society, and has sent
many fine drawings to the Exhibition.</p>

<p class = "paragraph">
<span class = "smallcaps">Mr. Creswick</span>, <ins class = "correction"
title = ", missing">R.A.,</ins> the distinguished painter, has
occasionally drawn on wood, but more as a favour than part of his
<i>métier</i>. The present specimen, one of a series contributed to the
Book of British Ballads, is so highly praised by Mr. Ruskin, and at the
same time so elaborately criticised, that we think it in place to quote
his words. After comparing him advantageously with Poussin, he proceeds
to say, “Who with one thought or memory of nature in his heart could
look at the two landscapes, and receive Poussin’s with ordinary
patience? Take Creswick in black and white, where he is unembarrassed by
his fondness for pea-green, the illustrations, for instance, to the
<i>Nut-Brown Maid</i>, in the Book of English Ballads. Look at the
intricacy and fulness of the dark oak foliage, where it bends over the
brook; see how you can go through it, and into it, and come out behind
it, to the quiet bit of sky. Observe the grey aërial transparency of the
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page589a" id = "page589a">
589*</a></span>
stunted copse on the left, and the entangling of the boughs where the
light near foliage detaches itself. Above all, note the forms of the
masses of light. Not things like scales or shells, sharp at the edge,
and flat in the middle, but irregular and rounded, stealing in and out
accidentally from the shadow, and presenting in general outline, as the
masses of all trees do, a&nbsp;resemblance to the specific forms of the
leaves of which they are composed. Turn over the page, and look into the
weaving of the foliage and sprays against the dark-night-sky, how near
they are, yet how untraceable; see how the moonlight creeps up
underneath them, trembling and shivering on the silver boughs above;
note also, the descending bit of ivy, on the left, of which only a few
leaves are made out, and the rest is confusion, or tells only in the
moonlight like faint flakes of snow.</p>
</div>

<div class = "mynote">
<p><a href = "#page_image">Page image</a> showing original layout.</p>
</div>

<p>“But nature observes another principle in her foliage, more important
even than its intricacy. She always secures an exceeding harmony and
repose. She is so intricate that her minuteness of parts becomes to the
eye, at a little, one united veil or cloud of leaves, to destroy the
evenness of which is perhaps a greater fault than to destroy its
transparency. Look at Creswick’s oak again, in its dark parts. Intricate
as it is, all is blended into a cloud-like harmony of shade, which
becomes fainter and fainter as it retires, with the most delicate
flatness and unity of tone. And it is by this kind of vaporescence, so
to speak, by this flat misty unison of parts, that nature and her
faithful followers are enabled to keep the eye in perfect repose in the
midst of profusion, and to display beauty of form wherever they choose,
to the greatest possible advantage, by throwing it across some quiet
visionary passage of dimness and rest.”</p>

<p>Mr. Creswick has recently contributed several vignettes to Tennyson’s
Poems. The following, engraved by <span class = "smallcaps">Mason

<p><span class = "smallcaps">George Cruikshank</span> is especially
celebrated for the felicitous humour which he throws into every subject
that comes under his pencil or burin. His works are legion and all
highly prized, but his designs on wood are much less numerous than his
etchings on copper. Mr. Ruskin, in his ‘Modern Painters,’ has lately
expatiated as enthusiastically on the artistic merits of Mr. Cruikshank
as he has done on those of Mr. Creswick, quoted by us in a previous
page. He concludes by saying: “Taken all in all, the works of Cruikshank
have the most sterling value of any belonging to this class produced in
England.” The present examples, taken from his ‘Three Courses and a
Dessert,’ published in Bohn’s Illustrated Library, will afford some idea
of his peculiar talent. On the following page we give examples of his
early work, being illustrations contributed to the ‘Universal Songster,’
a&nbsp;once popular work to which other artists including his late
brother Robert

<p>Our last page of illustrations is devoted to humour. Three of the

unsurpassed by anything he has since done.</p>

<p>These artists have in former years illustrated a number of books.
Among Crowquill’s may be named eight subjects to the Book of British
Ballads. His latest work is ‘The Adventures of Gooroo Simple and his
Five Disciples.’</p>

<p>The Publisher here concludes his additional chapter; not for want of
material, for he has more than enough to fill another volume, but for
want of space. In endeavouring to give some indication of xylographic
art-progress in England, he has made no attempt at completeness, and has
said nothing whatever of foreign art, which has progressed quite as
rapidly as our own. So much remains to be done in both domains, and so
many fine examples are either lying before him, or placed at his
disposal, which might advantageously have been adduced, that he
contemplates following the present volume, at no very distant period,
with one that shall supply what has now been necessarily omitted. Among
the many skilful Artists whose names have not yet been mentioned are the
following, arranged in three distinct alphabets. The first alphabet
comprises those who are professionally painters in oil, but occasionally
draw on wood; the second, those who make drawing on wood their leading
profession, although many of them also paint in oil; the third, those
who almost confine themselves to engraving the designs of others,
although some of them are themselves good draughtsmen. One or more of
the books to which they have contributed, are indicated.</p>
