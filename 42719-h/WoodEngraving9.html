less known to the public than that of wood engraving; and hence it
arises that most persons who have incidentally or even expressly written
on the subject have committed so many mistakes respecting the practice.
It is from a want of practical knowledge that we have had so many absurd
speculations respecting the manner in which the old wood engravers
executed their cross-hatchings, and so many <i>notions</i> about
vegetable putties and metallic relief engraving. Even in a Memoir of
Bewick, printed in 1836, we find the following passage, which certainly
would not have appeared had the writer paid any attention to the
numerous wood-cuts, containing cross-hatchings of the most delicate
kind, published in England between 1820 and 1834:&mdash;“The principal
characteristic of the ancient masters is the crossing of the black
lines, to produce or deepen the shade, commonly called
<i>cross-hatching</i>. Whether this was done by employing different
blocks, one after another, as in calico-printing and paper-staining,
<i>it may be difficult to say</i>; but to produce them on the same block
is so difficult and <i>unnatural</i>, that though Nesbit, one of
Bewick’s early pupils, attempted it on a few occasions, and the splendid
print of Dentatus by Harvey shows that it is not impossible even on a
large scale, yet the waste
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page562" id = "page562">
562</a></span>
of time and labour is scarcely worth the effect produced.”<a class =
"tag" name = "tagIX1" id = "tagIX1" href = "#noteIX1">IX.1</a> Now, the
difficulty of saying whether the old cross-hatchings were executed on a
single block, or produced by impressions from two or more, proceeds
entirely from the writer not being acquainted with the subject; had he
known that hundreds of old blocks containing cross-hatchings are still
in existence, and had he been in the habit of seeing similar
cross-hatchings executed almost daily by very indifferent wood
engravers, the difficulty which he felt would have vanished. “Unnatural”
is certainly an improper term for a <i>philosopher</i> to apply to a
process of art, merely because he does not understand it: with equal
reason he might have called every other process, both of copper-plate
and wood engraving, “unnatural;” nay, in this sense there is no process
in arts or manufactures to which the term “unnatural” might not in the
same manner be applied.</p>

<p>In giving some account of the practice of wood engraving, it seems
most proper to begin with the ground-work&mdash;the wood. As it is
generally understood that box is best adapted for the purposes of
engraving, and that it is generally used for cuts intended for the
illustration of books, there seems no occasion to enter into a detail of
all the kinds of wood that might be used for the more ordinary purposes
of large coarse cuts for posting-bills, and others of a similar
character. Mr. Savage, in his Hints on Decorative Printing, has copied
the principal part of what Papillon has said on the subject of wood,
intending that it should be received as information from a practical
wood engraver; but he has omitted to notice that much of what Papillon
says about the choice of wood, can be of little service in guiding the
modern English wood engraver, who executes his subject on the
cross-section of the wood, while Papillon and his contemporaries were
accustomed to engrave upon the side, or the <i>long-way</i> of the wood.
“There is no difficulty,” says Papillon, as translated by Mr. Savage,
“in distinguishing that which is good, as we have only need of taking a
splinter of the box we wish to try, and break it between the fingers; if
it break short, without bending, it will not be of any value; whereas,
if there be great difficulty in breaking it, it is well adapted to our
purpose.”</p>

<p>Now, it is quite evident from this direction&mdash;independent of the
fact being otherwise known&mdash;that the thin splinter by which the
quality of the wood was to be tested was to be cut the long way of the
wood: a&nbsp;similar cutting taken from the cross-section would break
short, however excellent the wood might be for the purpose of engraving.
Papillon’s direction is therefore calculated to mislead, unless
accompanied with an explanation of the manner in which the splinter is
to be taken; and it
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page563" id = "page563">
563</a></span>
is also utterly useless as a test of box that is intended to be engraved
on the cross-section, or end-way of the wood.</p>

<p>For the purposes of engraving no other kind of wood hitherto tried is
equal to box. For fine and small cuts the smallest logs are to be
preferred, as the smallest wood is almost invariably the best. American
and Turkey box is the largest; but all large wood of this kind is
generally of inferior quality, and most liable to split; it is also
frequently of a red colour, which is a certain characteristic of its
softness, and consequent unfitness for delicate engraving. From my own
experience, English box is superior to all others; for though small, it
is generally so clear and firm in the grain that it never crumbles under
the graver; it resists evenly to the edge of the tool, and gives not a
particle beyond what is actually cut out. The large red wood, on the
contrary, besides being soft, is liable to crumble and to cut short;
that is, small particles will sometimes <i>break</i> away from the sides
of the line cut by the graver, and thus cause imperfections in the work.
Box of large and comparatively quick growth, is also extremely liable to
shrink unevenly between the rings, so that after the surface has been
planed perfectly level, and engraved, it is frequently difficult to
print the cut in a proper manner, in consequence of the inequality of
the surface.</p>

<p>As even the largest logs of box are of comparatively small diameter,
it is extremely difficult to obtain a perfect block of a single piece
equal to the size of an octavo page. In order to obtain pieces as large
as possible, some dealers are accustomed to saw the log in a slanting
direction&mdash;in the manner of an oblique section of a
cylinder&mdash;so that the surface of a piece cut off shall resemble an
oval rather than a circle. Blocks sawn in this manner ought never to be
used; for, in consequence of the obliquity of the grain, there is no
preventing small particles tearing out when cutting a line.</p>

<p>Large red wood containing <i>white spots</i> or streaks is utterly
unfit for the purposes of the engraver; for in cutting a line across,
adjacent to these spots or streaks, sometimes the entire piece thus
marked will be removed, and the cut consequently spoiled. A&nbsp;clear
yellow colour, and as equal as possible over the whole surface, is
generally the best criterion of box-wood. When a block is not of a clear
yellow colour throughout, but only in the centre, gradually becoming
lighter towards the edges, it ought not to be used for delicate work;
the white, in addition to its not cutting so “sweetly,” being of a
softer nature, absorbs more ink than the yellow, and also retains it
more tenaciously, so that impressions from a block of this kind
sometimes display a perceptible inequality of colour;&mdash;from the
yellow parts allowing the ink to leave them freely, while the white
parts partially retain it, the printed cut has the appearance of having
received either too much ink in one place, or too
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page564" id = "page564">
564</a></span>
little in another. Besides this, the ink remaining on the white parts
becomes so adhesive, that, should the sheet be rather too damp
(as&nbsp;will frequently happen when much paper is wetted at one time),
it will sometimes stick to the paper; a&nbsp;small spot of white will
hence appear in the impression, while a minute piece of paper will
remain adhering to the block, to be mixed up with the ink on the balls,
and transferred as a black speck to another part of the cut in a
subsequent impression. But this is not all: should the piece of paper
remain unnoticed for some time it will make a small indention in the
block, and occasion a white or grey speck in the impressions printed
after its removal. Soft red and white box, more especially the latter,
being more porous than clear yellow, blocks of those kinds of wood are
most liable to be injured by the liquids used to clean them after
printing. Should the printer wash them with either lees or spirits of
turpentine, these fluids will enter the wood more freely than if it were
yellow, and cause it to expand in proportion to the quantity used, and
sometimes to such an extent as to distort the drawing. If a block of any
kind of box, whether red, white, or yellow, be wetted or exposed to
dampth, it will expand considerably;<a class = "tag" name = "tagIX2" id
= "tagIX2" href = "#noteIX2">IX.2</a> but with care it will return to
its former dimensions, should it have been sufficiently seasoned before
being printed. When, however, the expansion has been caused by lees or
spirits of turpentine, the block will never again contract to its
original size.<a class = "tag" name = "tagIX3" id = "tagIX3" href =
"#noteIX3">IX.3</a></p>

<p>As publishers frequently provide the drawings which are to be
engraved, perhaps a knowledge of the different qualities of box is as
necessary to them as to wood engravers themselves. In reply to this it
may be said, why not require the engraver who is to execute the cuts to
supply proper wood himself? Where only one engraver is employed to
execute all the cuts for a work, the choice of the wood may indeed be
very properly left to himself. But where several are employed, and each
required to send his own wood to the designer, very few are particular
what kind they send; for when the designer receives the different pieces
he generally consigns them to a drawer until wanted, and when he has
finished a design, he not unfrequently sends it to an engraver who did
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page565" id = "page565">
565</a></span>
not supply the identical piece of wood on which it is drawn. Hence
scarcely any engraver pays much attention to the kind of wood he sends;
for where many are employed in the execution of a series of cuts for the
same work, it is very unlikely that each will receive the drawings on
the wood supplied by himself. Even when the designer is particular in
making the drawings of the subjects which he thinks best suited to each
engraver’s talents on the wood which such engraver has supplied, it not
unfrequently happens that the person who employs the engravers will not
give the blocks to those for whom the artist intended them. Publishers
have a much greater interest in this matter than they seem to suspect.
If soft wood be supplied, the finer lines will soon be bruised down in
printing, and the cut will appear like an old one before half the number
of impressions required have been printed; if red-ringed, the surface is
extremely liable to become uneven, and also to warp and split.</p>

<p>As box can seldom be obtained of more than five or six inches
diameter, and as wood of this size is rarely sound throughout, blocks
for cuts exceeding five inches square are usually formed of two or more
pieces firmly united by means of iron pins and screws. Should the block,
however, be wetted or exposed to dampth, the joints are certain to open,
and sometimes to such an extent as to require a piece of wood to be
inserted in the aperture.<a class = "tag" name = "tagIX4" id = "tagIX4"
href = "#noteIX4">IX.4</a> Perhaps the best way to guard against a large
block opening at the joining of the pieces would be to enclose it with
an iron hoop or frame; such hoop or frame being fixed when nearly
red-hot in the same manner as a tire is applied to a coach or cart
wheel. If the iron fit perfectly tight when forced on to the block in
the manner of a tire, it will be the more likely, by its contracting in
cold and damp weather, to resist the expansive force of the wood at such
times.</p>

<p>Besides the hardness and toughness of box, which allows of clear
raised lines, capable of bearing the action of the press, being cut on
its surface, this wood, from its not being subject to the attacks of the
worm, has a great advantage over apple, pear-tree, beech,<a class =
"tag" name = "tagIX5" id = "tagIX5" href = "#noteIX5">IX.5</a> and other
kinds of wood, formerly used for the purposes of engraving. Its
preservation in this respect is probably owing to its poisonous nature,
for other kinds of wood of greater hardness and durability are
frequently pierced through and through by worms. The chips of box, when
chewed, are certainly unwholesome to human beings. A&nbsp;fellow-pupil,
who had acquired a habit of chewing the small pieces which he cut out
with his graver,
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page566" id = "page566">
566</a></span>
became unwell, and was frequently attacked with sickness. On mentioning
the subject to his medical adviser, he was ordered to refrain from
chewing the pieces of box; he accordingly took the doctor’s advice, gave
up his bad habit, and in a short time recovered his usual health.<a
class = "tag" name = "tagIX6" id = "tagIX6" href =
"#noteIX6">IX.6</a></p>

<p>Box when kept long in a dry place becomes unfit for the purpose of
engraving. I&nbsp;have at this time in my possession a drawing which has
been made on the block about ten years, but the wood has become so dry
and brittle that it would now be impossible to engrave the subject in a
proper manner.</p>

<p>When the wood does not cut clear, but crumbles as if it were too dry,
the defect may sometimes be remedied by putting the block into a deep
earthenware jug or pan, and placing such jug or pan in a cool place for
ten or twelve hours. When the wood is too hard and dry to be softened in
the above manner, I&nbsp;would recommend that the back of the block
should be placed in water&mdash;in a plate or large dish&mdash;to the
depth of the sixteenth part of an inch, for about an hour. If allowed to
remain longer there is a risk of the block afterwards splitting.</p>

<p class = "figfloat">
<a name = "illus_566" id = "illus_566">&nbsp;</a>
<img src = "images/illus_566.png" width = "85" height = "25"
alt = "see text"></p>

<p>Box, of whatever kind, when not well seasoned, is extremely liable to
warp and bend; but a little care will frequently prevent many of the
accidents to which drawings on unseasoned wood are exposed by neglect.
For instance, when a block is received by the engraver from the designer
or publisher, it ought, if not directly put in hand, to be placed on one
of its edges, and not, as is customary with many, laid down flat, with
the surface on which the drawing is made upwards. If a block of
unseasoned wood be permitted to lie in this manner for a week or two, it
is almost certain to turn up at the edges, the upper surface becoming
concave, and the lower convex, as is shown in the annexed cut,
representing the section of such a block.</p>

<p>The same thing will occur in the process of engraving, though to a
small extent, should the engraver’s hands be warm and moist; and also
when working by lamp-light without a globe filled with water between the
lamp and the block. Such slight warping in the course of engraving is,
however, easily remedied by laying the block with its face&mdash;that
is, the surface on which the drawing is made&mdash;downward on the desk
or table at all times when the engraver is not actually employed on the
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page567" id = "page567">
567</a></span>
subject. The block so placed, provided that it be not of very dry wood,
in a short time recovers its former level. When a block of very dry wood
becomes <i>dished</i>, or concave, on its upper surface, as shown in the
preceding cut, there is little chance of its ever again becoming
sufficiently flat to allow of its being well printed. When the deviation
from a perfect level at the bottom is not so great as to attract the
notice of the pressman previous to taking an impression, the block not
unfrequently yields to the action of the platten, and splits. The
fracture remains perhaps unobserved for a short time, and when it is at
length noticed, the block is probably spoiled beyond remedy.</p>

<p>When box is very dry it is extremely difficult to cut a clear line
upon it, as it crumbles, and small pieces fly out at the sides of the
line traced by the graver. The small white spots so frequently seen in
the delicate lines of the sky in wood-cuts are occasioned by particles
flying out in this manner. If a block consist partly of yellow wood and
partly of wood with red rings, the yellow will cut clear, while in the
red it will be almost impossible to cut a perfect line. When the same
piece of wood is yellow and red alternately it is extremely difficult to
produce an even <i>tint</i> upon it. Wood of this kind ought always to
be rejected, both from the difficulty of engraving upon it with
clearness, and from the uncertainty of the surface continuing perfectly
flat, as the red rings are more liable to shrink in drying than the
other parts, and, from their thus not receiving a sufficient quantity of
ink, to appear like so many rainbows in the impression.</p>

<p>The spaces between those rings are greater or less, accordingly as
the seasons have been favourable or unfavourable to the growth of the
tree. Besides the injurious effect which those red rings are apt to
produce in an impression, wood of this kind is very unpleasant and
uncertain to engrave on; for as the yellow parts cut pleasant and clear,
the engraver, unless particularly on his guard, is betrayed to trust to
the whole piece as being of the same uniform tenacity, and before he is
aware of its inequality in this respect, or can check the progress of
his graver, its point has entered one of those soft red rings, and, to
the injury of his work, has either caused a small piece to fly out, or
carried the line further than he intended. Wood of this kind is unfit
for anything except very common work, and ought never to be used for
delicate engraving. There is no certain means of forming a judgment of
box-wood until it be cut into slices or trencher-like pieces from the
log; for many logs which externally appear sound and of a good colour,
prove very faulty and cracked in the centre when sawn up. Turkey box is
in particular so defective in this respect that a large slice can seldom
be procured without a crack. This, probably, is occasioned by the manner
in which the tree is felled. Previous to their beginning to cut down
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page568" id = "page568">
568</a></span>
a tree the Turkish wood-cutters fasten a rope to the top, by means of
which they break the tree down when the bole is little more than half
cut through. The consequence is that a <i>shiver</i> frequently extends
through the most valuable portion of the log.</p>

<p>Many artists, who are not accustomed to make drawings on wood,
erroneously suppose that the block requires some peculiar preparation.
Nothing more is required than to rub the previously planed and smoothed
surface with a little powdered Bath-brick, slightly mixed with water: as
little water as possible is, however, to be used, as otherwise the block
will absorb too much, and be afterwards extremely liable to split. When
this thin coating is perfectly dry, it is to be removed by rubbing the
block with the palm of the hand. No part of the light powder ought to
remain, for, otherwise, the pencil coming in contact with it will make a
coarse and comparatively thick line, which, besides being a blemish in
the drawing, is very liable to be rubbed off. The object of using the
powdered Bath-brick is to render the surface less slippery, and thus
capable of affording a better <i>hold</i> to the point of the black-lead
pencil.</p>

<p>When the principal parts of the drawing are first washed in upon the
block in Indian ink, it is of great advantage to gently rub the surface
of the block, when dry, with a little dry and finely powdered
Bath-brick, before the drawing is completed with the black-lead pencil.
By this means the hard edges of the Indian-ink wash will be softened,
the different tints delicately blended, and the subsequent touches of
the pencil be more distinctly seen. Some artists, previous to beginning
to draw on the block, are in the habit of washing over the surface with
a mixture of flake-white and gum-water.<a class = "tag" name = "tagIX7"
id = "tagIX7" href = "#noteIX7">IX.7</a> This practice is, however, by
no means a good one. The drawing indeed may appear very bright and showy
when first made on such a white surface, but in the progress of
engraving a thin film of the preparation will occasionally rise up
before the graver and carry with it a portion of the unengraved work,
which the engraver is left to restore according to his ability and
recollection. This white ground also mixes with the ink in taking a
first proof, and fills up the finer parts of the cut. If a white wash be
used without gum, the drawing is very liable to be partially effaced in
the progress of engraving, and the engraver left to finish his work as
he can. The risk of this inconvenience ought to be especially avoided in
making drawings on a block, as the wood engraver has not the opportunity
of referring to another drawing or to an original painting in the manner
of an engraver on copper.</p>

<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page569" id = "page569">
569</a></span>
<p>The less that is done to change the original colour of the
wood&mdash;by white or any other preparation&mdash;so much the better
for the engraver; a&nbsp;piece of clear box is sufficiently light to
allow of the most delicate lines being distinctly drawn upon it. When
the surface of the block is whitened, another inconvenience arises
besides those already noticed. It is this: when the drawing is made upon
a white ground, and the subject partially engraved, the effect of the
whole becomes very confused and perplexing to the engraver in
consequence of the parts already engraved appearing nearly of the
original colour of the wood, while the ground of the parts not yet cut
is white, as first drawn. The engraver’s eye cannot correctly judge of
the whole, and the inconvenience is increased by his neither having an
original drawing to refer to, nor a proof to guide him: until the cut be
completed he has no means of correctly ascertaining whether he has left
too much <i>colour</i> or taken too much away.</p>

<p>The engraver on copper or on steel can have an impression of his
etching as soon as it is <i>bit</i> in, and can take impressions of the
plate at all times in the course of his progress; the wood engraver, on
the contrary, enjoys no such advantages; he is obliged to wait until all
be completed ere he can obtain an impression of his work. If the wood
engraver has kept his subject generally too dark, there is not much
difficulty in reducing it; but if he has engraved it too light, there is
no remedy. If a small part be badly engraved, or the block has sustained
an injury, the defect may be repaired by inserting a small piece of wood
and re-engraving it: this mode of repairing a block is technically
termed “<i>plugging</i>.”<a class = "tag" name = "tagIX8" id = "tagIX8"
href = "#noteIX8">IX.8</a></p>

<p>When a block requires to be thus amended or repaired, it is first to
be determined how much is necessary to be taken out that the restoration
may accord with the adjacent parts; for sometimes, in order to render
the insertion less perceptible, it may be requisite to take out rather
more than the part imactually perfect or injured. This being decided on,
a&nbsp;hole is drilled in the block, as is represented in the next page,
of a size sufficient to admit “the <i>plug</i>.” The hole ought not to
be drilled quite through the block, as the piece let in would, from the
shaking and battering of the press, be very likely to become loosened.
Should it receive more pressure at the top than bottom, it would sink a
little below the engraved surface of the block, and thus appear lighter
in the impression than the surrounding parts; while should it be
slightly forced up from below it, would appear darker,&mdash;in each
case forming
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page570" id = "page570">

a positive blemish in the cut.<a class = "tag" name = "tagIX9" id =
"tagIX9" href = "#noteIX9">IX.9</a> When the shape of the part to be
restored is too large to be covered with one circular plug, it is better
to add one plug to another till the whole be covered, than to insert one
of a different shape, and thus fill the space at once. When a single
plug is used the section appears thus;</p>

the plug being driven in like a wedge, and having a vacant space around
it at the bottom. If an oblong space of the form No.&nbsp;1. is to be
restored, it will be best effected by first inserting a plug at each
end, as at No.&nbsp;2, then adding two others, as at No.&nbsp;3, and
finally wedging them all fast by a central plug, as at No.&nbsp;4, like
the key-stone in an arch. When a plug is firmly fixed, the top is
carefully cut down to the level of the block, and the part of the
subject wanting re-drawn and engraved. When these operations are well
performed no trace of the insertion can
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page571" id = "page571">

THE PLUG OUT.</p>

<p>When a cast is taken from a block which requires the insertion of a
plug, the best mode is to have the part intended to be renewed cast
blank. In this case a hole of sufficient size is to be drilled in the
block, and afterwards filled up with plaster to the level of the
surface. A&nbsp;cast being then taken, the part to be re-engraved
remains blank, but of a piece with the rest of the metal, so that there
is no possibility of its rising up above or sinking below the surface,
as sometimes happens when a plug is inserted in a wood-block. When the
part remaining blank in the cast is engraved in accordance with the work
of the surrounding parts, it is almost impossible to discover any trace
of the insertion. The following impression is from a cast of the block
illustrating the “plug,” with the part which appears white in the former
cut restored and re-engraved in this manner. A&nbsp;white circular line,
near the handle of the pail, has been purposely cut to indicate the
place of the plug.</p>

<p>Before beginning to engrave any subject, it is necessary to observe
whether the drawing be entirely, or only in part, made with a pencil. If
it be what is usually called a <i>wash</i> drawing, with little more
than the outlines in pencil, it is not necessary to be so cautious in
defending it from the action of the breath or the occasional touching of
the hand;
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page572" id = "page572">
572</a></span>
but if it be entirely in pencil, too much care cannot be taken to
protect it from both.</p>

<p>Before proceeding to engrave a delicate pencil drawing the block
ought to be covered with paper, with the exception of the part on which
it is intended to begin. Soft paper ought not to be used for this
purpose, as such is most likely to partially efface the drawing when the
hand is pressed upon the block. Moderately stout post-paper with a
glazed surface is the best; though some engravers, in order to preserve
their eyes, which become affected by white paper, cover the block with
blue paper, which is usually too soft, and thus expose the drawing to
injury. The dingy, grey, and over-done appearance of several modern
wood-cuts is doubtless owing, in a great measure, to the block when in
course of engraving having been covered with soft paper, which has
partially effaced the drawing. The drawing, which originally may have
been clear and <i>touchy</i>, loses its brightness, and becomes
indistinct from its frequent contact with the soft pliable paper; the
spirited dark touches which give it effect are rubbed down to a sober
grey, and all the other parts, from the same cause, are comparatively
weak. The cut, being engraved according to the appearance of the
drawing, is tame, flat, and spiritless.</p>

<img src = "images/illus_572.png" width = "122" height = "63"

<p>Different engravers have different methods of fastening the paper to
the block.<a class = "tag error" name = "tagIX10" id = "tagIX10" href =
"#noteIX10" title = "footnote tag missing">IX.10</a> Some fix it with
gum, or with wafers at the sides; but this is not a good mode, for as
often as it is necessary to take a view of the whole block, in order to
judge of the progress of the work, the paper must be torn off, and
afterwards replaced by means of new wafers or fresh gum, so that before
the cut is finished the sides of the block are covered with bits of
paper in the manner of a wall or shop-front covered with fragments of
posting-bills. The most convenient mode of fastening the paper is to
first wrap a piece of stiff and stout thread three or four times round
the edges of the block, and then after making the end fast to remove it.
The paper is then to be closely fitted to the block, and the edges being
brought over the sides, the thread is to be re-placed above it. If the
turns of the thread be too tight to pass over the last corner of the
block, <span class = "smallroman">A</span>, a piece of string, <span
class = "smallroman">B</span>, being passed within them and firmly
pulled, in the manner here represented, will cause them to stretch a
little and pass over on to the edge without difficulty. When this plan
is adopted the paper forms a kind of moveable cap, which can
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page573" id = "page573">
573</a></span>
be taken off at pleasure to view the progress of the work, and replaced
without the least trouble.</p>

<p>I have long been of opinion that many young persons, when beginning
to learn the art of wood engraving, have injured their sight by
unnecessarily using a magnifying glass. At the very commencement of
their pupilage boys will furnish themselves with a glass of this kind,
as if it were as much a matter of course as a set of gravers; they
sometimes see men use a glass, and as at this period they are prone to
ape their elders in the profession, <i>they</i> must have one also; and
as they generally choose such as magnify most, the result not
unfrequently is that their sight is considerably impaired before they
are capable of executing anything that really requires much nicety of
vision.</p>

<p>I would recommend all persons to avoid the use of glasses of any
kind, whether single magnifiers or spectacles, until impaired sight
renders such aids necessary; and even then to commence with such as are
of small magnifying power. The habit of viewing minute objects
alternately with a magnifying glass and the naked eye&mdash;applying the
glass every two or three minutes&mdash;is, I&nbsp;am satisfied,
injurious to the sight. The magnifying glass used by wood engravers is
similar to that used by watch-makers, and consists of a single lens,
fitted into a short tube, which is rather wider at the end applied to
the eye. As the glass seldom can be fixed so firmly to the eye as to
entirely dispense with holding it, the engraver is thus frequently
obliged to apply his left hand to keep it in its place; as he cannot
hold the block with the same hand at the same time, or move it as may be
required, so as to enable him to execute his work with freedom, the
consequence is, that the engraving of a person who is in the habit of
using a magnifying glass has frequently a cramped appearance. There are
also other disadvantages attendant on the habitual use of a magnifying
glass. A&nbsp;person using such a glass must necessarily hold his head
aside, so that the eye on which the glass is fixed may be directly above
the part on which he is at work. In order to attain this position, the
eye itself is not unfrequently distorted; and when it is kept so for any
length of time it becomes extremely painful. I&nbsp;never find my eyes
so free from pain or aching as when looking at the work directly in
front, without any twisting of the neck so as to bring one eye only
immediately above the part in course of execution. I&nbsp;therefore
conclude that the eyes are less likely to be injured when thus employed
than when one is frequently distorted and pained in looking through a
glass. I&nbsp;am here merely speaking from experience, and not
professedly from any theoretic knowledge of optics; but as I have
hitherto done without the aid of any magnifying power, I&nbsp;am not
without reason convinced that glasses of all kinds ought to be dispensed
with until impaired vision renders their use absolutely
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page574" id = "page574">
574</a></span>
necessary. I&nbsp;am decidedly of opinion that to use glasses <i>to
preserve</i> the sight, is to meet half way the evil which is thus
sought to be averted. A&nbsp;person who has his sense of hearing perfect
never thinks of using a trumpet or acoustic instrument in order to
preserve it. All wood engravers, whether their eyes be naturally weak or
not, ought to wear a shade, similar to that represented in the following
figure, No.&nbsp;1, as it both protects the eyes from too strong a
light, and also serves to concentrate the view on the work which the
engraver is at the time engaged in executing.</p>

<p>When speaking on this subject, it may not be out of place to mention
a kind of shade or screen for the nose and mouth, similar to that in the
preceding figure, No.&nbsp;2. Such a shade or screen is called by
Papillon a <i>mentonnière</i>,<a class = "tag" name = "tagIX11" id =
"tagIX11" href = "#noteIX11">IX.11</a> and its object is to prevent the
drawing on the block being injured by the breath in damp or frosty
weather. Without such a precaution, a&nbsp;drawing made on the block
with black-lead pencil would, in a great measure, be effaced by the
breath of the engraver passing freely over it in such weather. Such a
shade or screen is most conveniently made of a piece of thin pasteboard
or stiff paper.</p>

<p>There are various modes of protecting the eyes when working by
lamp-light, but I am aware of only one which both protects the eyes from
the light and the face from the heat of the lamp. This consists in
filling a large transparent glass-globe with clear water, and placing it
in such a manner between the lamp and the workman that the light, after
passing through the globe, may fall directly on the block, in the manner
represented in the following cut. The height of the lamp can be
regulated according to the engraver’s convenience, in consequence of its
being moveable on the upright piece of iron or other metal which forms
its support. The dotted line shows the direction of the light when the
lamp is elevated to the height here seen; by lowering the lamp a
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page575" id = "page575">
575</a></span>
little more, the dotted line would incline more to a horizontal
direction, and enable the engraver to sit at a greater distance. By the
use of those globes one lamp will suffice for three or four persons, and
each person have a much clearer and cooler light than if he had a lamp
without a globe solely to himself.<a class = "tag" name = "tagIX12" id =

<p>It has been said, and with some appearance of truth, that “the best
engravers use the fewest tools;” but this, like many other sayings of a
similar kind, does not generally hold good. He undoubtedly ought to be
considered the best engraver who executes his work in the <i>best
manner</i> with the fewest tools; while it is no less certain that he is
a bad engraver who executes his work badly, whether he use many or few.
No wood engraver who understands his art will incumber his desk or table
with a number of useless tools, though, from a regard to his own time,
he will take care that he has as many as are necessary. There are some
who pride themselves upon executing a great variety of work with one
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page576" id = "page576">
576</a></span>
tool, and hence, firmly believing in the truth of the saying above
quoted, fancy that they are first-rate engravers. Such would be better
entitled to the name if they executed their work well. A&nbsp;person who
makes his tools his <i>hobby-horse</i>, and who bestows upon their
ornaments&mdash;ebony or ivory handles, silver hoops, &amp;c.&mdash;that
attention which ought rather to be devoted to his subject, rarely excels
as an engraver. He who is vain of the beautiful appearance of his tools
has not often just reason to be proud of his work.</p>

<p>There are only four kinds of cutting tools<a class = "tag" name =
"tagIX13" id = "tagIX13" href = "#noteIX13">IX.13</a> necessary in wood
engraving, namely:&mdash;gravers; tint-tools; gouges or scoopers; and
flat tools or chisels. Of each of these four kinds there are various
sizes. The following cut shows the form of a graver that is principally
used for outlining or separating one figure from another. A, is the back
of the tool; B, the face; C, the point; and D, what is technically
called the belly. The horizontal dotted line, 1, 2, shows the surface of
the block, and the manner in which part of the handle is cut off after
the blade is inserted.<a class = "tag" name = "tagIX14" id = "tagIX14"
href = "#noteIX14">IX.14</a> This tool is very fine at the point, as the
line which it cuts ought to be so thin as not to be distinctly
perceptible when the cut is printed, as the intention is merely to form
a termination or boundary to a series of lines running in another
direction. Though it is necessary that the point should be very fine,
yet the blade ought not to be too thin, for then, instead of cutting out
a piece of the wood, the tool will merely make a delicate opening, which
would be likely to close as soon as the block should be exposed to the
action of the press. When the outline tool becomes too thin at the point
the lower part should be rubbed on a hone, in order to reduce the
extreme fineness.</p>

<img src = "images/illus_576b.png" width = "215" height = "82"

<p>About eight or nine gravers of different sizes, beginning from the
outline tool, are generally sufficient. The blades differ little in
shape, when first made, from those used by copper-plate engravers; but
in order to render them fit for the purpose of wood engraving, it is
necessary to give the points their peculiar form by rubbing them on a
Turkey stone. In this cut are shown the faces and part of the backs of
nine gravers of different sizes; the lower dotted line, <span class =
"smallroman">A&nbsp;C</span>, shows the extent to which the points of
such
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page577" id = "page577">
577</a></span>
tools are sometimes ground down by the engraver in order to render them
broader. When thus ground down the points are slightly rounded, and do
not remain straight as if cut off by the dotted line <span class =
"smallroman">A C</span>. These tools are used for nearly all kinds of
work, except for series of parallel lines, technically called “tints.”
The width of the line cut out, according to the thickness of the graver
towards the point, is regulated by the pressure of the engraver’s
hand.</p>

TINT-TOOL.</p>
<p class = "rightside">
GRAVER.</p>
</div>

<p>Tint-tools are chiefly used to cut parallel lines forming an even and
uniform <i>tint</i>, such as is usually seen in the representation of a
clear sky in wood-cuts. They are thinner at the back, but deeper in the
side than gravers, and the angle of the face, at the point, is much more
acute. About seven or eight, of different degrees of fineness, are
generally sufficient. The following cut will afford an idea of the shape
of the blades towards the point. The handle of the tint-tool is of the
same form as that of a graver. The figure marked A presents a side view
of the blade; the others marked B show the faces. Some engravers never
use a tint-tool, but cut all their lines with a graver. There is,
however, great uncertainty in cutting a series of parallel lines in this
manner, as the least inclination of the hand to one side will cause the
graver to increase the width of the white line <i>cut out</i>, and
undercut the raised one <i>left</i>, more than if in the same
circumstances a tint-tool were used. This will be rendered more evident
by a comparison of the points and faces of the two different tools: The
tint-tool, being very little thicker at B than at the point A, will
cause a very trifling difference in the width of a line in the event of
a wrong inclination, when compared with the inequality occasioned by the
unsteady direction of a graver, whose angle at the point is much greater
than that of a proper tint-tool. Tint-tools ought to be sufficiently
strong at the back to prevent their bending in the middle of the blade
when used, for with a weak tool of this kind the engraver cannot
properly guide the point, and hence freedom of execution is lost.
Tint-tools that are rather thick in the back are to be preferred to such
as are thin, not only from their allowing of great steadiness in
cutting, but from their leaving the raised lines thicker at the bottom,
and consequently more capable of sustaining the action of the press.
A&nbsp;tint-tool that is of the same thickness, both at the back and the
lower part, cuts out
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page578" id = "page578">
578</a></span>
the lines in such manner that a section of them appears thus:

the black or raised lines from which the impression is obtained being no
thicker at their base than at the surface; while a section of the lines
cut by a tool that is thicker at the back than at the lower part appears
thus.

Gouges of different sizes, from <span class = "smallroman">A</span> the
smallest to <span class = "smallroman">B</span> the largest, as here
represented, are used for scooping out the wood towards the centre of
the block; while flat tools or chisels, of various sizes, are chiefly
employed in cutting away the wood towards the edges. Flat tools of the
shape seen in figure <span class = "smallroman">C</span> are sometimes
offered for sale by tool-makers, but they ought never to be used; for
the projecting corners are very apt to cut <i>under</i> a line, and thus
remove it entirely, causing great trouble to replace it by inserting new
pieces of wood.</p>

<p>The face of both gravers and tint-tools ought to be kept rather long
than short; though if the point be ground <i>too fine</i>, it will be
very liable to break. When the face is long&mdash;or, strictly speaking,
when the angle, formed by the plane of the face and the lower line of
the blade, is comparatively acute&mdash;thus,
<span class = "figfloat">
<img src = "images/illus_578f.png" width = "126" height = "25"

a&nbsp;line is cut with much greater clearness than when the face is
comparatively obtuse, and the small shaving cut out turns gently over
towards the hand. When, however, the face of the tool approaches to the
shape seen in the following cut, the reverse happens; the small shaving
is rather ploughed out than cleanly cut out; and the force necessary to
push the tool forward frequently causes small pieces to fly out at each
side of the hollowed line, more especially if the wood be dry. The
shaving also, instead of turning aside over the face of the tool, turns
over before the point, thus,
<span class = "figfloat">
<img src = "images/illus_578g.png" width = "126" height = "22"
alt = "see text"></span>
and hinders the engraver from seeing that part of the pencilled line
which is directly under it. A&nbsp;short-faced tool of itself prevents
the engraver from distinctly seeing the point. When the face of a tool
has become obtuse, it ought to be ground to a proper form, for instance,
from the shape of the figure A to that of&nbsp;B.</p>

<p>Gravers and tint-tools when first received from the maker are
generally too hard,&mdash;a defect which is soon discovered by the point
breaking off short as soon as it enters the wood. To remedy this, the
blade of the tool ought to be placed with its flat side above a piece of
iron&mdash;a poker will do very well&mdash;nearly red-hot. Directly it
changes to a straw colour it is to be taken off the iron, and either
dipped in sweet oil or allowed to cool gradually. If removed from the
iron while it is still of a straw colour, it will have been softened no
more than sufficient; but should it have acquired a purple tinge, it
will have been softened too much; and instead of breaking at the point,
as before, it will bend. A&nbsp;small grindstone is of great service in
grinding down the faces of tools that have become obtuse. A&nbsp;Turkey
stone, though the operation requires more time, is however a very good
substitute, as, besides reducing the face, the tool receives a point at
the same time. Though some engravers use only a Turkey stone for
sharpening their tools, yet a hone in addition is of great advantage.
A&nbsp;graver that has received a final polish on a hone cuts a clearer
line than one which has only been sharpened on a Turkey stone; it also
cuts more pleasantly, gliding smoothly through the wood, if it be of
good quality, without stirring a particle on each side of the line.</p>

<p>The gravers and tint-tools used for engraving on a plane surface are
straight at the point, as is here represented; but for engraving on a
block rendered concave in certain parts by lowering, it is necessary
that the point should have a slight inclination upwards, thus. The
dotted lines show the direction of the point used for plane surface
engraving. There is no difficulty in getting a tool to <i>descend</i> on
one side of a part hollowed out or lowered; but unless the point be
slightly inclined upwards, as is here shown, it is extremely difficult
to make it <i>ascend</i> on the side opposite, without getting <i>too
much hold</i>, and thus producing a wider white line than was
intended.</p>

<p>As the proper manner of holding the graver is one of the first things
that a young wood engraver is taught, it is necessary to say a few words
on this subject. Engravers on copper and steel, who have much harder
substances than wood to cut, hold the graver with the fore-finger
extending on the blade beyond the thumb, thus, so that by its pressure
the point may be pressed into the plate. As box-wood, however, is much
softer than copper or steel, and as it is seldom of perfectly equal
hardness
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page580" id = "page580">
580</a></span>
throughout, it is necessary to hold the graver in a different manner,
and employ the thumb at once as a stay or rest for the blade, and as a
check upon the force exerted by the palm of the hand, the motion being
chiefly directed by the fore-finger, as is shown in the following
cut.</p>

<p class = "illustration">

<p>The thumb, with the end resting against the side of the block, in the
manner above represented, allows the blade to move back and forward with
a slight degree of pressure against it, and in case of a slip it is ever
ready to check the graver’s progress. This mode of resting the thumb
against the edge of the block is, however, only applicable when the cuts
are so small as to allow of the graver, when thus guided and controlled,
to reach every part of the subject. When the cut is too large to admit
of this, the thumb then rests upon the surface of the block, thus:</p>

still forming a stay to the blade of the graver, and a check to its

<p>In order to acquire steadiness of hand, the best thing for a pupil to
begin with is the cutting of tints,&mdash;that is, parallel lines; and
the first attempts ought to be made on a small block such as is
represented in No.&nbsp;1, which will allow each entire line to be cut
with the thumb resting against the edge. When lines of this length can
be cut with tolerable precision, the pupil should proceed to blocks of
the size of No.&nbsp;2. He ought also to cut waved tints, which are not
so difficult; beginning, as in straight ones, with a small block, and
gradually proceeding to blocks of greater size. Should the wood not cut
smoothly in the direction in which he has begun, he should reverse the
block, and cut his lines in the opposite direction; for it not
unfrequently happens that wood which cuts short and crumbles in one
direction will cut clean and smooth the opposite way. It is here
necessary to observe, that if a certain number of lines be cut in one
direction, and another portion, by reversing the block, be cut the
contrary way, the tint, although the same tool may have been used for
all, will be of two different shades, notwithstanding the pains that may
have been taken to keep the lines of an even thickness throughout. This
difference in the appearance of the two portions of lines cut from
opposite sides is entirely owing to the wood cutting more smoothly in
one direction than another, although the difference in the resistance
which it makes to the tool may not be perceptible by the hand of the
engraver. It is of great importance that a pupil should be able to cut
tints well before he proceeds to any other kind of work. The practice
will give him steadiness of hand, and he will thus acquire a habit of
carefully executing such lines, which subsequently will be of the
greatest service. Wood engravers who have not been well schooled in this
elementary part of their profession often cut their tints carelessly in
the first instance, and, when they perceive the defect in a proof,
return to their work; and, with great loss of time, keep thinning and
dressing the lines, till they frequently make the tint appear worse than
at first.</p>

<p>When uniform tints, both of straight and waved lines, can be cut with
facility, the learner should proceed to cut tints in which the lines are
of unequal distance apart. To effect this, tools of different sizes are
necessary; for in tints of this kind the different distances between the
black lines, are according to the width of the different tools used to
cut them; though in tints of a graduated tone of colour, the difference
is sometimes entirely produced by increasing the pressure of the graver.
In the annexed cut, No.&nbsp;3, the black lines are of equal thickness,
but the width of the white lines between them becomes gradually less
from the top to the bottom. By comparing it with No.&nbsp;4, the
difference between a uniform tint, where the lines are of the same
thickness and equally distant, and one where the distance between the
lines is unequal, will be more readily understood.</p>

<p>A straight-line tint, either uniform, or with the lines becoming
gradually closer without appearing darker, is generally adopted to
represent a clear blue sky. In No.&nbsp;3 the tint has been commenced
with a comparatively broad-pointed tool; and after cutting a few lines,
less pressure, thus allowing the black lines to come a little closer
together, has been used, till it became necessary to change the tool for
one less broad in the face. In this manner a succession of tools, each
finer than the preceding, has been employed till the tint was
completed.&mdash;To be able to produce a tint of delicately graduated
<i>tone</i>, it is necessary that the engraver should be well acquainted
with the use of his tools, and also have a correct eye. The following is
a specimen of a tint cut entirely with the same <i>graver</i>, the
difference in the colour being produced by increasing the pressure in
the lighter parts.</p>

Tints of this kind are obtained with greater facility and certainty by
using a graver, and
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page583" id = "page583">
583</a></span>
increasing the pressure, than by using several tint-tools. On comparing
No.&nbsp;3 with No.&nbsp;5, it will be perceived that the black lines in
the latter decrease in thickness as they approach the bottom of the cut,
while in the former they are of a uniform thickness throughout. If a
clear sky is to be represented, there is no other mode of making that
part near the horizon appear to recede except by means of fine black
lines becoming gradually closer as they descend, as seen in the tint
No.&nbsp;3. As the black lines in this tint are closer at the bottom
than at the top, it might naturally be supposed that the colour would be
<ins class = "correction" title = "text unchanged">proportionably</ins>
stronger in that part. It is, however, known by experience that the
unequal distance of the lines in such a tint does not cause any
perceptible difference in the colour; as the upper lines, in consequence
of their being more apart, print thicker, and thus counterbalance the
effect of the greater closeness of the others.</p>

<p>The two following cuts are specimens of tints represented by means of
waved lines: in No.&nbsp;6 the lines are slightly undulated; in
No.&nbsp;7 they have more of the appearance of zig-zag.</p>

<p>Waved lines are generally introduced to represent clouds, as they not
only form a contrast with the straight lines of the sky, but from their
form suggest the idea of motion. It is necessary to observe, that if the
alternate undulations in such lines be too much curved, the tint,
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page584" id = "page584">
584</a></span>
when printed, will appear as if intersected from top to bottom, like
wicker-work with perpendicular stakes, in the manner shown in the
following specimen, No.&nbsp;8. This appearance is caused by the unequal
pressure of the tool in forming the small curves of which each line is
composed, thus making the black or raised line rather thicker in some
parts than in others, and the white interstices wide or narrow in the
same proportion. The appearance of such a tint is precisely the same
whether cut by hand or by a machine.<a class = "tag" name = "tagIX15" id

<p>As the choice of proper tints depends on taste, no specific rules can
be laid down to guide a person in their selection. The proper use of
lines of various kinds as applied to the execution of wood-cuts, is a
most important consideration to the engraver, as upon their proper
application all indications of form, texture, and conventional colour
entirely depend. Lines are not to be introduced merely as such,&mdash;to
display the mechanical skill of the engraver; they ought to be the signs
of an artistic meaning, and be judged of accordingly as they serve to
express it with feeling and correctness. Some wood engravers are but too
apt to pride themselves on the delicacy of their <i>lining</i>, without
considering whether it be well adapted to express their subject; and to
fancy that excellence in the art consists chiefly in cutting with great
labour a number of delicate unmeaning lines. To such an extent is this
carried by some of this class that they spend more time in expressing
the mere scratches of the designer’s pencil in a shade than a Bewick or
a Clennell would require to engrave a cut full of meaning and interest.
Mere delicacy of lines will not, however, compensate for want of natural
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page585" id = "page585">
585</a></span>
expression, nor laborious trifling for that vigorous execution which is
the result of feeling. “Expression,” says Flaxman, “engages the
attention, and excites an interest which compensates for a multitude of
defects&mdash;whilst the most admirable execution, without a just and
lively expression, will be disregarded as laborious inanity, or
contemned as an illusory endeavour to impose on the feelings and the
understanding.&mdash;Sentiment gives a sterling value, an irresistible
charm, to the rudest imagery or the most unpractised scrawl. By this
quality a firm alliance is formed with the affections in all works of
art.”<a class = "tag" name = "tagIX16" id = "tagIX16" href =
"#noteIX16">IX.16</a> Perpetrators of laborious inanities find, however,
their admirers; and an amateur of such delicacies is in raptures with a
specimen of “exquisitely fine lining,” and when told that such
wood-<i>peckings</i> are, as works of art, much inferior to the
productions of Bewick, he asks where his works are to be found; and
after he has examined them he pronounces them “coarse and
tasteless,&mdash;the rude efforts of a <i>country</i> engraver,” and not
to be compared with certain delicate, but spiritless, wood engravings of
the present day.</p>

<p>With respect to the direction of lines, it ought at all times to be
borne in mind by the wood engraver,&mdash;and more especially when the
lines are not <i>laid in</i> by the designer,&mdash;that they should be
disposed so as to denote the peculiar form of the object they are
intended to represent. For instance, in the limb of a figure they ought
not to run horizontally or vertically,&mdash;conveying the idea of
either a flat surface or of a hard cylindrical form,&mdash;but with a
gentle curvature suitable to the shape and the degree of rotundity
required. A&nbsp;well chosen line makes a great difference in properly
representing an object, when compared with one less appropriate, though
more delicate. The proper disposition of lines will not only express the
form required, but also produce more <i>colour</i> as they approach each
other in approximating curves, as in the following example, and thus
represent a variety of light and shade, without the necessity of
introducing other lines crossing them, which ought always to be avoided
in small subjects: if, however, the figures be large, it is necessary to
break the hard appearance of a series of such single lines by crossing
them with others more delicate.</p>

<p>In cutting curved lines, considerable difficulty is experienced by
not commencing properly. For instance, if in executing a series of such
lines as are shown in the preceding cut, the engraver commences at A,
and works towards B, the tool will always be apt to cut through the
black line already formed; whereas by commencing at B, and working
towards A, the graver is always outside of the curve, and consequently
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page586" id = "page586">
586</a></span>
never touches the lines previously cut.<a class = "tag" name = "tagIX17"
id = "tagIX17" href = "#noteIX17">IX.17</a> This difference ought always
to be borne in mind when engraving a series of curved lines, as, by
commencing properly, the work is executed with greater freedom and ease,
while the inconvenience arising from slips is avoided. When such lines
are introduced to represent the rotundity of a limb, with a break of
white in the middle expressive of its greatest prominence, as is shown
in the following figure A, it is advisable that they should be first
<i>laid in</i> as if intended to be continuous, as is seen in figure B,
and the part which appears white in A <i>lowered</i> out before
beginning to cut them, as by this means all risk of their disagreeing,
as in C, will be avoided.</p>

<p>The rotundity of a column or similar object is represented by means
of parallel lines, which are comparatively open in the middle where
light is required, but which are engraved closer and thicker towards the
sides to express shade. The effect of such lines will be rendered more
evident by comparing the column in the annexed cut with the square base,
which is represented by a series of equidistant lines, each of the same
thickness as those in the middle of the column.</p>

<p>Many more examples of tints and simple lines might be given; but, as
no real benefit would be derived from them, it is needless to increase
the number, and make “much ado about nothing.” Every new subject that
the engraver commences presents something new for him to effect, and
requires the exercise of his taste and judgment as to the best mode of
executing it, so that the whole may have some claim to the character of
a work of art. If a thousand examples were given, they would not enable
an engraver to
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page587" id = "page587">
587</a></span>
execute a subject properly, unless he were endowed with that indefinable
<i>feeling</i> which at once suggests the best means of attaining his
end. Such feeling may indeed be excited, but can never be perfectly
communicated by rules and examples. In this respect every artist,
whether a humble wood engraver, or a sculptor or a painter of the
highest class, must be self-instructed; the feeling displayed in his
works must be the result of his own perceptions and ideas of beauty and
propriety. It is the difference in feeling, rather than any greater or
less degree of excellence in the mechanical execution, that
distinguishes the paintings of Raffaele from those of Le Brun, Flaxman’s
statues from those of Roubilliac, and the cuts in the Lyons Dance of
Death from many of the laborious inanities of the present day.</p>

<p>Clear, unruffled water, and all bright and smooth metallic
substances, are best represented by single lines; for if cross-lines be
introduced, except to indicate a strong shadow, it gives to them the
appearance of roughness, which is not at all in accordance with the
ideas which such substances naturally excite. Objects which appear to
reflect brilliant flashes of light ought to be carefully dealt with,
leaving <i>plenty of black</i> as a ground-work, for in wood engravings
such lights can only be effectively represented by contrast with deep
<i>colour</i>. Reflected lights are in general best represented by means
of single lines running in the direction of the object, with a few
touches of white judiciously taken out. In this respect Clennell
particularly excelled as a wood engraver. Painting itself can scarcely
represent reflected lights with greater effect than he has expressed
them in several of his cuts. In Harvey’s large cut of the Death of
Dentatus, after Haydon’s noble picture, the shield of Dentatus affords
an instance of reflected light most admirably represented.</p>

<p>As my object is to point out to the uninitiated the method of cutting
certain lines, rather than to engage in the fruitless task of showing
how such lines are to be generally applied, I&nbsp;shall now proceed to
offer a few observations on engraving in outline, a&nbsp;process with
which the learner ought to be well acquainted before he attempts
subjects consisting of complicated lines. The word <i>outline</i> in
wood engraving has two meanings: it is used, first, to denote the
distinct boundaries of all kinds of objects; and secondly, to denote the
delicate white line that is cut round any figure or object in order to
form a boundary to the lines by which such figure or object is
surrounded, and to thus allow of their easier liberation: it forms as it
were a terminal furrow into which the lines surrounding the figure run.
In speaking of this second outline in future, it will be distinguished
as the <i>white outline</i>; while the other, which properly defines the
different figures and forms, will be called the true or proper outline,
or simply
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page588" id = "page588">
588</a></span>
the outline, without any distinctive additional term. As the white
outline ought never to be distinctly visible in an impression, care
ought to be taken, more especially where the adjacent tint is dark, not
to cut it too deep or too wide. In the first of the two following cuts,
the white outline, intentionally cut rather wider than is necessary, is
distinctly seen from its contrast with the dark parts immediately in
contact with it.</p>

<p class = "illustration">
<a name = "illus_588" id = "illus_588">&nbsp;</a>
<img src = "images/illus_588a.png" width = "271" height = "216"
alt = "see text"></p>

<p class = "continue">
In the second cut of the same subject, with a different back-ground, it
is less visible in consequence of the parts adjacent being light. It is,
however, still distinctly seen in the shadow of the feet; but it is
shown here purposely to point out an error which is sometimes committed
by cutting a white outline where, as in these parts, it is not required.
The white outline is here quite unnecessary, as the two blacks
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page589" id = "page589">
589</a></span>
ought not to be separated in such a manner; the proper intention of the
white outline is not so much to define the form of the figure or object,
but, as has been already explained, to make an incision in the wood as a
boundary to <i>other lines</i> coming against it, and to allow of their
being clearly liberated without injury to the proper outline of the
object: when a line is cut to such a boundary, the small shaving forced
out by the graver becomes immediately released, without the point of the
tool coming in contact with the true outline. The old German wood
engravers, who chiefly engraved large subjects on apple or pear tree,
and on the <i>side</i> of the wood, were not in the habit of cutting a
white outline round their figures before they began to engrave them, and
hence in their cuts objects frequently appear <i>to stick</i> to each
other. The practice is now, however, so general, that in many modern
wood-cuts a white line is improperly seen surrounding every figure.</p>

<p class = "illustration">
<img src = "images/illus_588b.png" width = "177" height = "184"
alt = "see text"></p>

<p>In proceeding to engrave figures, it is advisable to commence with
such as consist of little more than outline, and have no shades
expressed by cross-lines. The first step in executing such a subject is
to cut a white line on each side of the pencilled lines which are to
remain in relief of the height of the plane surface of the block, and to
form the impression when it is printed. A&nbsp;cut when thus engraved,
and previous to the parts which are white, when printed, being cut away,
or, in technical language, <i>blocked out</i>, would present the
following appearance.<a class = "tag" name = "tagIX18" id = "tagIX18"

<p class = "continue">
It is, however, necessary to observe that all the parts which require to
be blocked away have been purposely retained in this cut in order to
show more clearly the manner in which it is executed; for the engraver
usually cuts away as he proceeds all the black masses seen within the
subject. A&nbsp;wide margin of solid wood round the edges of the cut is,
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page590" id = "page590">
590</a></span>
however, generally allowed to remain until a proof be taken when the
engraving is finished, as it affords a support to the paper, and
prevents the exterior lines of the subject from appearing too hard. This
margin, where room is allowed, is separated from the engraved parts by a
moderately deep and wide furrow, and is covered with a piece of paper
serving as a <i>frisket</i> in taking a proof impression by means of
friction. In clearing away such of the black parts in the preceding cut
as require to be removed, it is necessary to proceed with great care in
order to avoid breaking down or cutting through the lines which are to
be left in relief. When the cut is properly cleared out and blocked
away, it is then finished, and when printed will appear thus:</p>

<p>Sculptures and bas-reliefs of any kind are generally best represented
by simple outlines, with delicate parallel lines, running horizontally,
to represent the ground. The following cut is from a design by Flaxman
for the front of a gold snuff-box made by Rundell and Bridge for George
IV. about 1827.</p>

The subject of this design was intended to commemorate the General Peace
concluded in 1814: to the left Agriculture is seen flourishing under the
auspices of Peace; while to the right a youthful figure is seen placing
a wreath above the helmet of a warrior; the trophy indicates his
services, and opposite to him is seated a figure of Victory. The three
other sides, and the top and bottom, were also
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page591" id = "page591">
591</a></span>
embellished with figures and ornaments in relief designed by Flaxman.
The whole of the dies were cut in steel by Henning and Son&mdash;so well
known to admirers of art from their beautiful reduced copies and
restorations of the sculptures of the Parthenon preserved in the British
Museum&mdash;and from these dies the plates of gold composing the box
were struck, so that the figures appear in slight relief. A&nbsp;blank
space was left in the top of the box for an enamel portrait of the King,
which was afterwards inserted, surrounded with diamonds, and the margin
of the lid was also ornamented in the same manner. This box is perhaps
the most beautiful of the kind ever executed in any country: it may
justly challenge a comparison with the drinking cups by Benvenuto
Cellini, the dagger hafts designed by Durer, or the salts by Hans
Holbein. The process of engraving in this style is extremely simple, as
it is only necessary to leave the lines drawn in pencil untouched, and
to cut away the wood on each side of them. An amateur may without much
trouble teach himself to execute cuts in this manner, or to engrave
fac-similes of small pen-and-ink sketches such as the annexed.<a class =

<p>Having now explained the mode of procedure in outline engraving, it
seems necessary, before proceeding to speak of more complicated
subjects, to say a few words respecting drawings made on the block; for,
however well the engraving may be executed, the cut which is a
fac-simile of a bad drawing can never be a good one. An artist’s
knowledge of drawing is put to the test when he begins to make designs
on wood; he cannot resort, as in painting, to the trick of colour to
conceal the defects of his outlines. To be efficient in the engraving,
his principal figures must be distinctly made out; a&nbsp;drawing on the
wood admits of no <i>scumbling</i>; black and white are the only means
by which the subject can be represented; and if he be ignorant of the
proper management of chiaro-scuro, and incorrect and feeble in his
drawing, he will not be able
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page592" id = "page592">
592</a></span>
to produce a really good design for the wood engraver. Many persons can
paint a tolerably good picture who are utterly incapable of making a
passable drawing on wood. Their drawing will not stand the test of
simple black and white; they can indicate generalities “indifferently
well” by means of positive colours, but they cannot delineate individual
forms correctly with the black-lead pencil. It is from this cause that
we have so very few persons who professedly make designs for wood
engravers; and hence the sameness of character that is to be found in so
many modern wood-cuts. It is not unusual for many second and third rate
painters, when applied to for a drawing for a wood-cut, to speak
slightingly of the art, and to decline to furnish the design required.
This generally results rather from a consciousness of their own
incapacity than from any real contempt for the art. As greater painters
than any now living have made designs for wood engravers in former
times, a&nbsp;second or third rate painter of the present day surely
could not be much degraded by doing the same. The true reason for the
refusal, however, is generally to be found in such painter’s
incapacity.</p>

<p>The two next cuts, both drawn from the same sketch,<a class = "tag"

different persons, will show how much depends upon having a good,
artist-like drawing. The first is meagre; the second, on the contrary,
is remarkably spirited, and the additional lines which are introduced
not only give effect to the figure, but also in printing form a support
to the more delicate parts of the outline.</p>

<p>Though a learner in proceeding from one subject to another more
complicated will doubtless meet with difficulties which may occasionally
damp his ardour, yet he will encounter none which will not yield to
earnest perseverance. As it is not likely that any amateur practising
the art merely for amusement would be inclined to test his patience by
proceeding beyond outline engraving, the succeeding remarks are more
especially addressed to those who may wish to apply themselves to wood
engraving as a profession.</p>

<p>When beginning to engrave in outline, it is advisable that the
subjects first attempted should be of the most simple
kind,&mdash;similar, for instance, to the preceding figure marked
No.&nbsp;1. When facility in executing cuts in this style is obtained,
the learner may proceed to engrave such as are slightly shaded, and have
a back-ground indicated as in No.&nbsp;2. He may next proceed to
subjects containing a greater variety of lines, and requiring greater
neatness of execution, but should by no means endeavour to get on too
fast by attempting to do <i>much</i> before he can do a little
<i>well</i>. Whatever kind of subject be chosen, particular attention
ought to be paid to the causes of failure and success in the execution.
By diligently noting what produces a good effect in certain subjects, he
will, under similar circumstances, be prepared to apply the same means;
and by attending to the faults in his work he will be the more careful
to avoid them in future. The group of figures here, selected from Sir
David Wilkie’s picture of the Rent Day, will serve as an example of a
cut executed by comparatively simple means; the subject is also
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page594" id = "page594">
594</a></span>
such a one as a pupil may attempt after he has made some progress in
engraving slightly shaded figures. There are no complicated lines which
are difficult to execute; the hatchings are few, and of simple
character; and for the execution of the whole, as here represented,
nothing is required but a <i>feeling</i> for the subject; and a moderate
degree of skill in the use of the graver, combined with patient
application.</p>

<p class = "illustration">
<a name = "illus_593" id = "illus_593">&nbsp;</a>
<img src = "images/illus_593.png" width = "297" height = "285"
alt = "see text"></p>

<p>When the pupil is thus far advanced, he ought, in subjects of this
kind, to avoid introducing more work, more especially in the features,
than he can execute with comparative facility and precision; for, by
attempting to attain excellence before he has arrived at mediocrity, he
will be very likely to fail, and instead of having reason to
congratulate himself on his success, experience nothing but
disappointment. To make wood engraving an interesting, instead of an
irksome study to young persons, I&nbsp;would recommend for their
practice not only such subjects as are likely to engage their attention,
but also such as they may be able to finish before they become weary of
their task. At this period every endeavour ought to be made to smooth
the pupil’s way by giving him such subjects to execute as will rather
serve to stimulate his exertions than exhaust his patience. Little
characteristic figures, like the one here copied, from one of Hogarth’s
plates of the Four Parts of the Day, seem most suitable for this
purpose. A&nbsp;subject of this kind does not contain so much work as to
render a young person tired of it before
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page595" id = "page595">
595</a></span>
it be finished; while at the same time it serves to exercise him in the
practice of the art and to engage his attention.</p>

<p class = "illustration">
<a name = "illus_594" id = "illus_594">&nbsp;</a>
<img src = "images/illus_594.png" width = "225" height = "296"
alt = "see text"></p>

<p>When a pupil feels no interest in what he is employed on, he will
seldom execute his work well; and when he is kept too long in engraving
subjects that merely try his patience, he is apt to lose all taste for
the art, and become a mere mechanical cutter of lines, without caring
for what they express.</p>

<p>Such a cut as the following&mdash;copied from an etching by
Rembrandt&mdash;will form a useful exercise to the pupil, after he has
attained facility in the execution of outline subjects, while at the
same time it will serve to display the excellent effect in wood
engravings of well contrasted light and shade. The hog&mdash;which is
here the principal object&mdash;immediately arrests the eye, while the
figures in the back-ground, being introduced merely to aid the
composition and form a medium between the dark colour of the animal and
the white paper, consist of little more than outline, and are
comparatively light. In engraving the hog, it is necessary to exercise a
little judgment in representing the bristly hair, and in <i>touching</i>
the details effectively.</p>

<p class = "illustration">
<a name = "illus_595" id = "illus_595">&nbsp;</a>
<img src = "images/illus_595.png" width = "307" height = "268"

<p>When a learner has made some progress, he may attempt such a cut as
that on the next page in order to exercise himself in the appropriate
representation of animal texture. The subject is a dray-horse, formerly
belonging to Messrs. Meux and Co., and the drawing was made on the block
by James Ward, R.A., one of the most distinguished animal painters of
the present time. Such a cut, though executed by simple
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page596" id = "page596">
596</a></span>
means, affords an excellent test of a learner’s skill and
discrimination: the hide is smooth and glossy; the mane is thick and
tangled; the long flowing hair of the tail has to be represented in a
proper manner; and the markings of the joints require the exercise of
both judgment and skill. By attending to such distinctions at the
commencement of his career, he will find less difficulty in representing
objects by appropriate texture when he shall have made greater progress,
and will not be entirely dependent on a designer to <i>lay in</i> for
him every line. An engraver who requires every line to be drawn, and who
is only capable of executing a fac-simile of a design made for him on
the block, can never excel.</p>

<p>As enough perhaps has been said in explanation of the manner of
cutting tints, and of figures chiefly represented by single lines,
I&nbsp;shall now give a cut&mdash;Jacob blessing the children of
Joseph&mdash;in which single-lined figures and tint are combined. It is
necessary to observe that this cut is not introduced as a good specimen
of engraving, but as being well adapted, from the simplicity of its
execution, to illustrate what I have to say. The figures are represented
by single lines, which require the exercise of no great degree of skill;
and by the introduction of a varied tint as a back-ground the cut
appears like a complete subject, and not like a sketch, or a detached
group.</p>

<p>It is necessary to remark here, that when comparatively light
objects, such as the figures here seen, are to be relieved by a tint of
any kind, whether darker or lighter, such objects are now generally
separated from it by a black outline. The reason for leaving such an
outline in parts where the conjunction of the tint and the figures does
not render it absolutely <i>necessary</i> is this: as those parts in a
cut which appear white
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page597" id = "page597">
597</a></span>
in the impression are to be cut away&mdash;as has already been
explained,&mdash;it frequently happens that when they are cut away
<i>first</i>, and the tint cut afterwards, the wood breaks away near the
termination of the line before the tool arrives at the blank or white.
It is, therefore, extremely difficult to preserve a distinct outline in
this manner, and hence a black <i>conventional</i> outline is introduced
in those parts where properly there ought to be none, except such as is
formed by the tint <i>relieving</i> against the white parts, as is seen
in the back part of the head of Jacob in the present cut, where there is
no other outline than that which is formed by the tint relieving against
his white cap. Bewick used to execute all his subjects in this manner;
but he not unfrequently carried this principle too far, not only running
the lines of his tints into the white on the <i>light</i> side of his
figures,&mdash;that is, on the side on which the light falls,&mdash;but
also on both sides of a light object.</p>

<p class = "illustration">
<a name = "illus_597" id = "illus_597">&nbsp;</a>
<img src = "images/illus_597.png" width = "274" height = "310"
alt = "see text"></p>

<p>Before dismissing this part of the subject, it is necessary to
observe further, that when the white parts are cut away before the tint
is introduced, the conventional black outline is very liable to be cut
through by the tool slipping. This will be rendered more intelligible by
an inspection of the following cut,<a class = "tag" name = "tagIX21" id
= "tagIX21" href = "#noteIX21">IX.21</a> where the house is seen
finished,
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page598" id = "page598">
598</a></span>
and the part where a tint is intended to be subsequently engraved
appears black. Any person in the least acquainted with the practice of
wood engraving, will perceive, that should the tool happen to slip when
near the finished parts, in coming directly towards them, it will be
very likely to cut the outline through, and to make a breach in
proportion as such outline may be thin, and thus yield more readily to
the force of the tool.</p>

<p class = "illustration">
<a name = "illus_598" id = "illus_598">&nbsp;</a>
<img src = "images/illus_598a.png" width = "214" height = "144"
alt = "see text"></p>

<p>When the tint is cut <i>first</i>, instead of being left to be
executed last, as it would be in the preceding cut, the mass of wood out
of which the house is subsequently engraved serves as a kind of barrier
to the tool in the event of its slipping, and allows of the tint being
cut with less risk quite up to the white outline. By attending to such
matters, and considering what part of a subject can be most safely
executed first, a&nbsp;learner will both avoid the risk of cutting
through his outline, and be enabled to execute his work with comparative
facility. The following cut is an example of the tint being cut first.
For the information of those who are unacquainted with the process of
wood engraving, it is necessary to remark that the parts which appear
positively black are those which remain untouched by the graver.</p>

<p class = "illustration">
<img src = "images/illus_598b.png" width = "216" height = "129"

<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page599" id = "page599">

<p>The following subject, copied from one of Rembrandt’s etchings, is
chiefly represented by black lines crossing each other. Such lines,
usually termed <i>cross-hatchings</i>, are executed with great facility
in copper and steel, where they are cut <i>into</i> the metal; but in
wood engraving, where they are left in <i>relief</i>, it requires
considerable time and attention to execute them with delicacy and
precision. In order to explain more clearly the difficulty of executing
cross-hatchings, let it be conceived that this cut is a drawing made on
a block, and that the engraver’s object is to produce a fac-simile of
it: now, as each black line is to be left in relief, it is evident that
he cannot imitate the cross-hatchings seen in the arms, the neck, and
other parts, by cutting the lines continuously as in engraving on
copper, which puts black <i>in</i> by means of an incision, while in
wood engraving a similar line takes it <i>out</i>. As the wood engraver,
then, can only obtain white by cutting out the parts that are to appear
so in the impression, while the black is to be left in relief, the only
manner in which he is enabled to represent <i>cross-hatchings</i>, or
<i>black lines crossing each other</i>, is to cut out singly with his
graver every one of the white interstices. Such an operation, as will be
evident from an inspection of this cut, necessarily requires not only
patience, but also considerable skill to perform it in a proper
manner,&mdash;that is, to cut each
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page600" id = "page600">
600</a></span>
white space cleanly out, and to preserve the lines of a regular
thickness. From the supposed impossibility of executing such cross
lines, it has been conjectured that many of the old wood-cuts containing
such work were engraved in metallic relief: this opinion, however, is
sufficiently refuted, by the fact of hundreds of blocks containing
cross-hatchings being still in existence, and by the much more delicate
and difficult work of the same kind displayed in modern wood engravings.
Not only are cross-hatchings of the greatest delicacy now executed in
England, but to such a degree of refinement is the process occasionally
carried, that small black <i>touches</i>&mdash;such as may be perceived
in the preceding cut in the folds of the sleeve above the elbow of the
right arm&mdash;are left in the white interstices between the lines.
Cross-hatchings, where the interstices are entirely white, are executed
by means of a lozenge-pointed tool, and the piece of wood is removed at
two <i>cuts</i>, each beginning at the opposite angles. Where a small
black touch is left within the interstices, the operation becomes more
difficult, and is performed by cutting round such minute touch of black
with a finely pointed graver.</p>

<p class = "illustration">
<a name = "illus_599" id = "illus_599">&nbsp;</a>
<img src = "images/illus_599.png" width = "296" height = "329"
alt = "see text"></p>

<p>The various conjectures that have been propounded respecting the mode
in which cross-hatchings have been effected in old wood-cuts require no
argument to refute them, as they are directly contradicted both by
undoubted historical facts, and by every day’s experience. Vegetable
putties, punches, and metallic relief are nothing but the trifling
speculations of persons who are fonder of propounding theories to
display their own ingenuity than willing to investigate facts in order
to arrive at the truth. It has happened rather unfortunately, that most
persons who have hitherto written upon the subject have known very
little about the practice of wood engraving, and have not thought it
worth their while to consult those who were able to give them
information. There is, however, no fear now of a young wood engraver
being deterred from attempting cross-hatchings on learning from certain
heretofore authorities on the subject that such work could not be
executed on wood. He now laughs at <i>vegetable putties</i>,
<i>square-pointed punches</i> for indenting the block to produce
cross-hatchings, and <i>metallic relief</i>: by means of his graver
alone he produces a practical refutation of every baseless theory that
has been propounded on the subject.</p>

<p>The right leg of Dentatus in Mr. Harvey’s large wood engraving after
Mr. Haydon’s picture is perhaps the most beautiful specimen of
cross-hatching that ever was executed on wood; and, in my opinion, it is
the best engraved part of the whole subject. Through the kindness of Mr.
Harvey, I&nbsp;have obtained a cast of this portion of the block, from
which the present impression is printed. The lines showing the muscular
rotundity and action of the limb are as admirably <i>laid in</i> as they
are beautifully engraved. In the wider and stronger cross-hatchings
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page601" id = "page601">
601</a></span>
of the drapery above, the small black touches previously mentioned are
perceived in the lozenge-shaped interstices.</p>

<p>From an opinion that the excellence of an engraving consists chiefly
in the difficulty of its execution, we now frequently find
cross-hatchings in several modern wood-cuts, more especially in such as
are manufactured for the French market, where a better effect would have
been produced by simpler means. Cross-hatchings, <i>properly
introduced</i>, undoubtedly improve a subject; and some parts of large
figures, such as the leg of Dentatus, cannot be well expressed without
their aid, as a series of curved lines on a limb, when not crossed,
generally cause it to appear stiff and rigid. By crossing them, however,
by other lines properly <i>laid in</i>, the part assumes a most soft and
natural appearance.</p>

<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page602" id = "page602">

<p>As the greatest advantage which wood engraving possesses over copper
is the effective manner in which strongly contrasted light and shade can
be represented, Rembrandt’s etchings,&mdash;which, like his paintings,
are distinguished by the skilful management of the
chiaro-scuro&mdash;form excellent studies for the engraver or designer
on wood who should wish to become well acquainted with the capabilities
of the art. A&nbsp;delicate wood-cut, executed in imitation of a smooth
steel-engraving of “sober grey” tone, is sure to be tame and insipid;
and whenever wood engravers attempt to give to their cuts the appearance
of copper or steel-plates, and neglect the peculiar advantages of their
own art, they are sure to fail, notwithstanding the pains they may
bestow. Their work, instead of being commended as a successful
application of the peculiar means of the art, is in effect condemned by
being regarded as “a&nbsp;clever <i>imitation</i> of a
copper-plate.”</p>

<p>The above cut of Christ and the Woman of Samaria, copied from an
etching by Rembrandt, will perhaps more forcibly illustrate what has
been said with respect to wood engraving being excellently adapted to
effectively express strong contrasts of light and shade. The original
etching&mdash;which has been faithfully copied&mdash;is a good example
of
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page603" id = "page603">
603</a></span>
Rembrandt’s consummate skill in the management of chiaro-scuro;
everything that he has wished to forcibly express immediately arrests
the eye, while in the whole design nothing appears abrupt. The extremes
of light and shade concentre in the principal figure, that of Christ,
and to this everything else in the composition is either subordinate or
accessory. The middle tint under the arched passage forms a medium
between the darkness of Christ’s robe and the shade under the curve of
the nearest arch, and the light in the front of his figure is gradually
carried off to the left through the medium of the woman and the distant
buildings, which gradually approach to the colour of the paper. Were a
tint, however delicate, introduced in this subject to represent the sky,
the effect would be destroyed; the parts which are now so effective
would appear spotted and confused, and have a crude, unfinished
appearance. By the injudicious introduction of a tinted sky many
wood-cuts, which would otherwise be striking and effective, are quite
spoiled.</p>

<p>It but too frequently happens when works are illustrated with
wood-cuts, that subjects are chosen which the art cannot successfully
represent. Whether the work to be illustrated be matter of fact or
fiction, the designer, unless he be acquainted both with the
capabilities and defects of the art, seldom thinks of more than making a
drawing according to his own fancy, and never takes into consideration
the means by which it has to be executed. To this inattention may be
traced many failures in works illustrated with wood-cuts, and for which
the engraver is censured, although he may have, with great care and
skill, accomplished all that the art could effect. An artist who is
desirous that his designs, when engraved on wood, should appear like
impressions from <i>over-done</i> steel-plates, ought never to be
employed to make drawings for wood engravers: he does not understand the
peculiar advantages of the art, and his designs will only have a
tendency to bring it into contempt, while those who execute them will be
blamed for the defects which are the result of his want of
knowledge.</p>

<p>Delicate wood engravings which are made to look well in a proof on
India paper by rubbing the ink partially off the block in the lighter
parts&mdash;in the manner described by Papillon at page
466&mdash;generally present a very different appearance when printed,
either with or without types in the same page. Lines which are cut too
thin are very liable to turn down in printing from their want of
support; and hence cuts consisting chiefly of such lines are seldom so
durable as those which display more black, and are executed in a more
bold and effective style. A&nbsp;designer who understands the
peculiarities of wood engraving will avoid introducing delicate lines in
parts where they receive no support from others of greater strength or
closeness near to them, but are exposed
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page604" id = "page604">
604</a></span>
to the unmitigated force of the press. Cuts in proportion to the
quantity of <i>colour</i> which they display are so much the better
enabled to bear the action of the press; the delicate lines which they
contain, from their receiving support from the others, are not only less
liable to break down, but, from their contrast with the darker parts of
the subject, appear to greater advantage than in a cut which is of a
uniformly grey tone. I&nbsp;am not, however, the advocate of
<i>black</i>, and little else, in a wood-cut; on the contrary, I&nbsp;am
perfectly aware of the absurdity of introducing patches of black without
either meaning or effect. What I wish to inculcate is, that a wood-cut
to have a good effect must contain more of properly contrasted black and
white than those who wish their cuts to appear like imitations of steel
or copper-plate engravings are willing to allow. As wood engraving is
not well adapted to represent subjects requiring great delicacy of lines
and variety of tints, such will be generally avoided by a designer who
understands the art; while, on the contrary, he will avail himself of
its advantages in representing well contrasted light and shade in a
manner superior to either copper-plate or steel engraving. Of all modern
engravers on wood, none understood the advantages of their art in this
respect better than Bewick and Clennell: the cuts of their engraving are
generally the most effective that have ever been executed.</p>

<p>Night-pieces, where the light is seen proceeding from a lantern,
a&nbsp;lamp, or any other luminous object, can be well represented by
means of wood engraving, although such subjects are very seldom
attempted. An engraved wood-block, which contains a considerable
proportion of positive black, prints much better than a copper-plate
engraving of the same kind; in the former the ink is distributed of an
even thickness over the <i>surface</i>, and is evenly pressed upon the
paper; in the latter the ink forms a little pool in the <i>hollowed
parts</i>, and, instead of being evenly taken up by the paper which is
<i>pressed into</i> it, adheres only partially, thus giving in the
corresponding parts a blurred appearance to the impression. For the
effective representation of such scenes as Meg Merrilies watching by a
feeble light the dying struggles of a smuggler, or Dirk Hatterick in the
Cave, from Sir Walter Scott’s Guy Mannering, wood engraving is
peculiarly adapted,&mdash;that is, supposing the designer, in addition
to possessing a knowledge of chiaro-scuro, to be also capable of drawing
correctly, and of treating the subject with proper <i>feeling</i>. Some
idea of the capability of the art in this respect may be formed from the
following cut&mdash;the Flight into Egypt,&mdash;copied from an etching
by Rembrandt. The mere work in this cut is of a very simple character;
there are no lines of difficult execution; and the only parts that are
lowered are those which represent the rays of light seen proceeding from
the lantern.</p>

<p>As the wood engraver can always get his subject <i>lighter</i>, but
cannot reproduce the black which he has cut away, he ought to be careful
not to get his subject too light before he has taken a proof; and even
in reducing the <i>colour</i> according to the touchings of the designer
on the proof, he ought to proceed with great circumspection; and where
his own judgment informs him that to take out all the black marked for
excision would be to spoil the cut, the safest mode would be to take out
only a part, and not remove all at once; for by strictly adhering to the
directions of an artist who knows very little of the real advantages of
wood engraving, it will not unfrequently happen that the cut so amended
will to himself, when printed, appear worse than it did in its first
state. In the following cut too much has been done in this respect; it
has been touched and retouched so often, in order to make it appear
delicate, that the spirit of the original drawing has been entirely
lost. In this instance the fault was not that of the artist, but of the
engraver, who “would not let well alone;” but, in order to improve his
work, as he
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page606" id = "page606">
606</a></span>
fancied, kept <i>trimming</i> the parts which gave effect to the whole
till he made it what it now appears. So far as relates to the execution
of the lines, the subject need not have been better; but, from the
engraver’s having taken away too much colour in places where it was
necessary, the whole has the appearance of middle tint, the excellence
of the original drawing is lost, and in its stead we have a dull, misty,
spiritless wood engraving.</p>

<p>In every cut there ought to be a principal object to first arrest the
attention; and if this cannot be effected from want of interest in such
object considered singly, the designer ought to make the general subject
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page607" id = "page607">
607</a></span>
pleasing to the eye by skilful composition or combination of forms, and
the effective distribution of light and shade.</p>

<p>The preceding cut&mdash;a moonlight scene&mdash;when compared with
the previous one, will show how much depends on an engraver having a
proper <i>feeling</i> for his subject. So far as relates to the mere
execution of the lines, this cut is decidedly inferior to the former;
but, viewed as a production of art, and as a spirited representation of
the original drawing, it is very much superior: in the former we see
little more than mechanical dexterity; while in the latter we perceive
that the engraver has, from a greater knowledge of his art, produced a
pleasing effect by comparatively simple means. The former cut displays
more mechanical skill; the latter more artistic feeling. The one
contains much delicate work, but is deficient in spirit; the other,
which has been produced with little more than half the labour, is more
effective because the subject has been better understood.</p>

<p>The following cut, representing a landscape, with the effect of the
setting sun, displays great delicacy of execution; but the labour here
is not thrown away, as in the sea-piece just mentioned: manual dexterity
in the use of the graver is combined with the knowledge of an artist,
and the result is a wood engraving at once delicate in execution and
spirited in its general effect.</p>

<p>A volume might be filled with examples and comments on them, and I
might, like Papillon, <i>instruct</i> the reader in the practice of the
art, by informing him how many times the graver would have to enter the
wood in order to produce a certain number of lines in relief; but I have
no inclination to do either the one or the other: my object is to make
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page608" id = "page608">
608</a></span>
a few observations on some of the most important and least understood
points in the practice of wood engraving, and to illustrate them with
examples, rather than to enter into minute details, which would be
uninteresting to the general reader, and useless to the learner who has
made any progress in the art. The person who wishes to acquire a
knowledge of wood engraving, with the view of practising it
professionally, must generally be guided by his own judgment and
feeling; for he who requires the aid of rules and examples in every
possible case will never attain excellence. A&nbsp;learner ought not to
put much trust in what is said about the beautiful wood-cuts&mdash;or
<i>plates</i>, as some critics call them&mdash;which appear in modern
publications. He ought to examine for himself, and not pin his faith to
ephemeral commendations, which are often the customary acknowledgment
for a presentation copy of the work. It is not unusual to find very
ordinary wood-cuts praised as displaying the very perfection of the art,
while others of much greater merit are entirely overlooked.</p>

<p>The person who wishes to excel as a wood engraver,&mdash;that is, to
display in his cuts the knowledge and feeling of an artist, as well as
the mechanical dexterity of a workman,&mdash;ought always to bear in
mind that those who rank highest in modern times, not only as engravers,
but also as designers on wood, have generally adopted the simplest means
of effecting their purpose, and have never introduced unmeaning
cross-hatchings, when working from their own drawings, merely to display
their skill in execution. In representing a peasant supping his
porridge, they have not spent a day on the figure, and two in delicately
engraving the bowl. It may almost be said that Bewick never employed
cross-hatchings; for, in the two or three instances in which he
introduced such lines, it has been rather for the sake of experiment
than to improve the appearance of the cut. Though one of the finest
specimens of this kind of work ever executed on wood is to be found in
Mr. Harvey’s cut of Dentatus, yet, on other occasions, when he engraved
his own designs, he seldom introduced cross-hatchings when he could
accomplish the same object by simpler means. A&nbsp;wood engraving,
viewed as a <i>work of art</i>, is <i>not</i> good in proportion as many
of its parts have the appearance of fine lace. Bewick’s birds and
tail-pieces are not, in my opinion, less excellent because they do not
display so much <i>work</i> as a modern wood-cut which contains numerous
cross-hatchings. Several of the best French designers on wood of the
present day appear to have formed erroneous opinions on this subject;
and hence we find in many of their designs much of the engraver’s time
spent in the execution of parts which are unimportant, while others,
where expression or feeling ought to be shown, are treated in a careless
manner. Many of their designs seem to have been made rather to test the
patience
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page609" id = "page609">
609</a></span>
of the engraver as a <i>workman</i> than to display his ability as an
<i>artist</i>. The following cut, from a cast of a part of the Death of
Dentatus, is introduced to show in how simple and effective a manner Mr.
Harvey has represented the shield of the hero. An inferior artist would
be very likely to represent such an object by means of complicated
lines, which, while they would be less effective, would require nearly a
week to engrave.</p>

<p>Considering the number of wood engravings that are yearly executed in
this country, it is rather surprising that there should hitherto have
been so few persons capable of making a good drawing on wood. Till
within
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page610" id = "page610">
610</a></span>
the last few years, it might be said that there was probably not more
than one <i>artist</i> in the kingdom possessing a knowledge of design
who professionally devoted himself to making drawings on the block for
wood engravers. Whenever a good original design is wanted, there are
still but few persons to whom the English wood engraver can apply with
the certainty of obtaining it; for though some of our most distinguished
painters have occasionally furnished designs to be engraved on wood, it
has mostly been as a matter of especial favour to an individual who had
an interest in the work in which such designs were to appear. In this
respect we are behind our French neighbours; the more common kind of
French wood-cuts containing figures are much superior to our own of the
same class; the drawing is much more correct, more attention is paid to
costume, and in the details we perceive the indications of much greater
knowledge of art than is generally to be found in the productions of our
second-rate occasional designers on wood. It cannot be said that this
deficiency results from want of encouragement; for a designer on wood,
of even moderate abilities, is better paid for his drawings than a
second-rate painter is for his pictures. The truth is, that a taste for
correct drawing has hitherto not been sufficiently cultivated in
England: our artists are painters before they can draw; and hence,
comparatively few can make a good design on wood. They require the aid
of positive colours to deceive the eye, and prevent it from resting upon
the defects of their drawing. It is therefore of great importance that a
wood engraver should have some knowledge of drawing himself, in order
that he may be able to correct many of the defects that are to be found
in the commoner kind of subjects sent to him to be engraved.</p>

<p>In the execution of subjects which require considerable time, but
little more than the exercise of mechanical skill, it is frequently
advisable to adopt the principle of <i>the division of labour</i>, and
have the work performed, as it were, by instalments, allotting to each
person that portion of the subject which he is likely to execute best.
In this manner the annexed cut of Rouen Cathedral has been engraved by
four different persons; and the result of their joint labours is such a
work as not even the best engraver of the four could have executed by
himself. Each having to do but a little, and that of the kind of work in
which he excelled, has worked <i>con amore</i>, and finished his task
before he became weary of it.</p>

<p>Though copper-plate engraving has a great advantage over wood when
applied to the execution of maps, in consequence of the greater delicacy
that can be given to the different shades and lines, indicating hills,
rivers, and the boundaries of districts, and also from the number of
names that can be introduced, and from the comparative facility of
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page611" id = "page611">
611</a></span>
executing them; yet, as maps engraved on copper, however simple they may
be, require to be printed separately, by means of a <ins class =
"correction" title = "comma invisible">rolling-press,</ins> the
unavoidable expense frequently renders it impossible to give such maps,
even when necessary, in books published at a low price. Under
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page612" id = "page612">
612</a></span>
such circumstances, where little more than outlines, with the course of
rivers, and comparatively few names, are required, wood engraving
possesses an advantage over copper, as such maps can be executed at a
very moderate expense, and printed with the letter-press of the work for
which they are intended. As the names in maps engraved on wood are the
most difficult parts of the subject, the method of drilling holes in the
block and inserting the names in type&mdash;as was adopted in the maps
to Sebastian Munster’s Cosmography, Basle, 1550,<a class = "tag" name =
"tagIX22" id = "tagIX22" href = "#noteIX22">IX.22</a>&mdash;has recently
been revived. The names in the outline maps contained in the Penny
Cyclopædia are inserted in this manner. Had those maps not been engraved
on wood, it would have been impossible that any could have been given in
the work, as the low price at which it is published would
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page613" id = "page613">
613</a></span>
not have allowed of their being engraved on copper, and, consequently,
printed by means of a rolling-press at an additional expense.</p>

<p>When, however, a map is of small dimensions, and several names in
letters of comparatively large size are required to be given, this
method of piercing the block can scarcely be applied without great risk
of its breaking to pieces under the press, in consequence of its being
weakened in parts by the holes drilled through it being so near
together.<a class = "tag" name = "tagIX23" id = "tagIX23" href =
"#noteIX23">IX.23</a> This inconvenience, however, may be remedied by
engraving the names in <i>intaglio</i> where they are most numerous, and
afterwards cutting a <i>tint</i> over them, so that when printed they
may appear white on a dark ground. Other names beyond the boundary of
the map can be inserted, where necessary, in type. The preceding
skeleton map of England and Wales, showing the divisions of the counties
and the course of the principal rivers, has been executed in this
manner: all the names on the land, and the courses of the rivers, were
first engraved on the smooth surface of the block in
<i>intaglio</i>&mdash;in less than a third of the time which would have
been required to engrave them in relief; the tint was next cut; and
lastly, the block was pierced, and all the other names inserted in type,
with the exception of the word “ENGLAND” in the title, which was
engraved in the same manner as the names on the land.</p>

<p>As what has been previously said about the practice of the art
relates entirely to engraving where the lines are of the same height, or
in the same plane, and when the impression is supposed to be obtained by
the pressure of a flat surface, I&nbsp;shall now proceed to explain the
practice of lowering, by which operation the surface of the block is
either scraped away from the centre towards the sides, or, as may be
required, hollowed out in other places. The object of thus lowering a
block is, that the lines in such places may be less exposed to pressure
in printing, and thus appear lighter than if they were of the same
height as the others. This method, though it has been claimed as a
modern invention, is of considerable antiquity, having been practised in
1538, as has been previously observed at <a href =
"WoodEngraving7.html#page462">page 462</a>. Instances of lowering are
very frequent in cuts engraved by Bewick; but until within the last five
or six years the practice was not resorted to by south-country
engravers. It is absolutely necessary that wood-cuts intended to be
printed by a steam-press should be lowered in such parts as are to
appear light; for, as the pressure on the cut proceeds from the even
surface of a metal cylinder covered with a blanket, there is no means of
<i>helping</i> a cut, as is generally done when printed by a hand-press,
by means of <i>overlays</i>. Overlaying consists in pasting pieces of
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page614" id = "page614">
614</a></span>
paper either on the front or at the back of the outer tympan,
immediately over such parts of the block as require to be printed dark;
and the effect of this is to increase the action of the platten on those
parts, and to diminish it on such as are not overlaid. When lowered
blocks are printed at a common press, it is necessary that a blanket
should be used in the tympans, in order that the paper may be pressed
into the hollowed or lowered parts, and the lines thus <i>brought
up</i>. The application of the steam-press to printing lowered wood-cuts
may be considered as an epoch in the history of wood engraving.
Wood-cuts were first printed <i>by a steam-press</i> at Messrs. Clowes
and Sons’ establishment,<a class = "tag" name = "tagIX24" id = "tagIX24"
href = "#noteIX24">IX.24</a> and since that time <i>lowering</i> has
been more generally practised than at any former period.</p>

<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page615" id = "page615">

<p>By means of simply lowering the edges of a block, so that the surface
shall be convex instead of plane, the lines are made to diminish in
strength as they recede from the centre until they become gradually
blended with the white paper on which the cut is printed. This is the
most simple mode of lowering, and is now frequently adopted in such cuts
as are termed <i>vignettes</i>,&mdash;that is, such as are not bounded
by definite lines surrounding them in the manner of a border. In the
preceding cut, representing a group from Sir David Wilkie’s painting of
the Village Festival, in the National Gallery, the light appearance of
the lines towards the edges has been produced in this manner.</p>

<p>Mr. Landseer, in his Lectures on Engraving, observes that hard edges
are incident to wood-cut vignettes. He was not aware of the means by
which this objectionable appearance could be remedied. The following are
his observations on this subject: “A&nbsp;principal beauty in most
vignettes consists in the delicacy with which they appear to relieve
from the white paper on which they are printed. The objects of which
vignettes consist, themselves forming the boundary of the composition,
their extremities should for the most part be tenderly blended&mdash;be
almost melted, as it were, into the paper, or ground. Now, in printing
with the letter-press, the pressure is rather the strongest at the
extremities of the engraving, where we wish it to be weakest, and it is
so from the unavoidable swelling of the damp paper on which the
impressions are worked, and the softness of the blankets in the tympans
of the press. Hence, hard, instead of soft edges, are incident to
vignettes engraven on wood, which all the care of the printer, with all
the modern accuracy of his machine, can rarely avoid.”</p>

<p>Mr. Landseer’s objection to vignettes engraved on wood applies only
to such as are engraved on a plane surface, since by lowering the block
towards the edges, lines gradually blending with the white paper can be
obtained with the greatest facility. For the representation of such
subjects,&mdash;supposing that their principal beauty consists in “the
delicacy with which they appear to relieve from the white
paper,”&mdash;wood engraving is as well adapted as engraving on copper
or steel. Though it is certainly desirable that the lines in a vignette
should gradually become blended with the colour of the paper, yet
something more is required in an engraving of this kind, whether on wood
or on metal. Much depends on its form harmonizing with the composition
of the subject: a&nbsp;beautiful drawing reduced to an irregular shape,
and having the edges merely softened, will not always constitute a good
vignette. Of this we have but too many instances in modern copper-plate
engravings, as well as wood-cuts. Of all modern artists J.&nbsp;M.
W.&nbsp;Turner, R.A., and W.&nbsp;Harvey appear to excel in giving to
their vignettes a form suitable to the composition.</p>

<p>Perhaps it may not be out of place to say a few words here on the
original meaning of the word <i>vignette</i>, which is now generally
used to signify either a wood-cut or a copper-plate engraving which is
not inclosed by definite lines forming a border. The word is French, and
is synonymous with the Latin <i>viticula</i>, which means a little vine,
or a vine shoot, such as is here represented.</p>

commencement of this paragraph, is an example of an old vignette; it is
copied from a manuscript apparently of the thirteenth century, formerly
belonging to the monastery of Durham, but now in the British Museum.
Subsequently the word was used to signify any large ornament at the top
of a page; in the seventeenth century all kinds of printer’s ornaments,
such as flowers, head and tail-pieces, were generally termed vignettes;
and more recently the word has been used to express all kinds of
wood-cuts or copper-plate engravings which, like the group from the
Village Festival, are not inclosed within a definite border. Rabelais
uses the word to denote certain ornaments of goldsmith’s work on the

<p>Before introducing any examples of concave lowering in the middle of
a cut, it seems necessary to give first a familiar illustration of the
principle, in order that what is subsequently said upon this subject may
be the more readily understood.&mdash;The crown-piece of George IV.,
which every reader can refer to, will afford the necessary
illustrations. As the head of the King on the obverse, and the figures
of St. George, the horse, and the dragon, on the reverse, are in
<i>relief</i>,&mdash;that is, higher than the field,&mdash;it is
evident, that if the coin were printed, each side separately, by means
of pressure from an even surface, whether plane or cylindrical, covered
with a yielding material, such as a blanket or woollen cloth, so as to
press the paper against the field or lower parts, the impressions would
appear as follows,&mdash;that is, with the parts in relief darkest, and
the lower proportionably lighter from their being less exposed to
pressure.</p>

IMPRESSIONS FROM A SURFACE WITH THE FIGURES LOWERED, OR IN INTAGLIO.</p>

<p>Upon a knowledge of the principle here exemplified the practice of
lowering in wood engraving entirely depends. When a block is properly
lowered, there is no occasion for overlays; and when cuts are to be
printed at a steam-press,&mdash;where such means to increase the
pressure in some parts and diminish it in others cannot be employed
without great loss of time,&mdash;it becomes absolutely necessary that
the blocks should be lowered in the parts where it is intended that the
lines should appear light.</p>

<p>In order that a cut should be printed properly without overlays,
either at a common press with a blanket in the tympans, or at a
steam-press where the cylinder is covered with woollen cloth, it is
necessary that the parts intended to appear light should be lowered
before the lines seen upon them are engraved; and the mode of proceeding
in this case is as follows:&mdash;The designer being aware of the manner
in which the cut is to be printed, and understanding the practice of
lowering, first makes the drawing on the block in little more than
outline,<a class = "tag" name = "tagIX26" id = "tagIX26" href =
"#noteIX26">IX.26</a> and washes in with flake-white the parts which it
is necessary to lower. The block is then sent to the engraver, who, with
an instrument resembling a sharp-edged burnisher, or with a flat tool or
chisel, scrapes or pares away the wood in the parts indicated. When the
lowering is completed, the designer finishes the drawing, and the cut is
engraved. It is necessary to observe, that unless the person who makes
the drawing on the block perfectly understand the principle of lowering,
and the purposes for which it is intended, he will never be able to
design properly a subject intended to be printed by a steam-press.</p>

<p>When an object is to be represented dark upon a light ground, or upon
middle tint, the first operation in beginning to lower the block is to
cut a delicate white outline round the dark object, and proceed with a
flat tool or a scraper, as may be most convenient, to take a thin
shaving or paring off those parts on which the background or middle tint
is to be engraved. The extent to which the block must be lowered will
depend on the degree of lightness intended to be given to such parts. In
Bewick’s time, when the pressmen used leather balls to ink the cuts and
types, it was only necessary to take a very thin shaving off the block
in order to produce the desired effect; as such balls, from the want of
elasticity in the leather, which was comparatively hard and unyielding,
would only touch lightly such parts as were below the level of the other
lines and the face of the types: had the block been lowered to any
considerable depth, such parts would not have received any ink, and
consequently would not have shown the lines engraved on them in the
impression. In the present day, when composition rollers are used, it is
necessary to lower the parts intended to appear light to a much greater
depth than formerly;<a class = "tag" name = "tagIX27" id = "tagIX27"
href = "#noteIX27">IX.27</a> as such rollers, in consequence of their
greater elasticity, are pressed, in the process of inking, to a
considerably greater depth between the lines of a cut than the old
leather balls. The preceding cut&mdash;a Shepherd’s Dog, drawn by
W.&nbsp;Harvey,&mdash;is printed from
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page621" id = "page621">
621</a></span>
a block in which both the fore-ground and distance are lowered to give
greater effect to the animal. If such a cut, printed in the same page
with types, as it appears here, were inked with leather balls,
a&nbsp;considerable portion of the lowered parts would not be visible.
This cut illustrates the principle of printing from a surface&mdash;such
as that of a coin&mdash;in which the head or figure is in relief.</p>

<p>In the next cut, an Egret, from a drawing by W. Harvey, the figure of
the bird appears white on a dark ground,&mdash;the reverse of the cut of
the Shepherd’s Dog,&mdash;and is an example of lowering the block in the
middle in the manner of a die with the figures in intaglio, or a cast
from a coin in which the head or figures are in relief.</p>

<p class = "illustration">

<p>In a cut of this kind the general form of the principal object
required to be light is first lowered out, and the drawing of the figure
being next completed upon the hollowed part, the engraver proceeds to
cut the lines, beginning with the back-ground and finishing the
principal object last. In cutting the lines in the hollowed part, the
engraver uses such a tool, slightly curving upwards towards the point,
as has been previously described at page 579. In lowering the principal
object in a cut of this kind, the greatest attention is necessary in
order that the hollowed parts may be gradually concave, and also of a
sufficient depth. In performing this operation, the engraver is solely
guided by his own judgment; and unless he have some practical knowledge
of the extent to which composition balls and rollers will
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page622" id = "page622">
622</a></span>
penetrate in such hollowed parts, it is almost impossible that he should
execute his work in a proper manner;&mdash;should he succeed, it will
only be by chance, like a person shooting at a mark blindfolded. In such
cases, though no special rules can be given, it is necessary to observe
that the part lowered will, in proportion to its area, be exposed to
receive nearly the same quantity of ink, and the same degree of
pressure, as the lines on a level with the types. The <i>depth</i> to
which such parts require to be lowered will consequently depend on their
extent; and the degree of lightness intended to be given to the lines
engraved on them. This, however, will be best illustrated by the annexed
diagram. If, for instance, the part to be lowered extend from <span
class = "smallroman">A</span> to <span class = "smallroman">B</span>, it
will be necessary to hollow the block to the depth indicated by the
dotted line <span class = "smallroman">A</span>&nbsp;c&nbsp;<span class
= "smallroman">B</span>. Should it extend from <span class =
"smallroman">A</span> to <span class = "smallroman">D</span>, it will
require to be lowered to the depth of the dotted line <span class =
"smallroman">A</span>&nbsp;e&nbsp;<span class = "smallroman">D</span> in
order to obtain the same degree of lightness in colour as in the lowered
part <span class = "smallroman">A</span>&nbsp;c&nbsp;<span class =
"smallroman">B</span> of less area,&mdash;that is, supposing the
engraved lines in both cases to be of equal delicacy.</p>

<p>As overlaying such delicately engraved cuts as require the greatest
attention in printing occupies much time, and lays the press idle during
the process, the additional sum charged per sheet for works containing a
number of such cuts has frequently operated to the disadvantage of wood
engraving, by causing its productions to be dispensed with in many books
where they might have been introduced with great advantage, both as
direct and incidental illustrations. It is, therefore, of great
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page623" id = "page623">
623</a></span>
importance to adapt the art of wood engraving to the execution of cuts
of all kinds, whether comparatively coarse or of the greatest delicacy,
so that they may be properly printed at the least possible expense.</p>

<p class = "illustration">

<p>The preceding cut, with the two following, which have all been
lowered, would, if printed at a steam-press, appear nearly as well as
they do in the present work, where they have been printed by means of a
common press with a blanket. But such a subject&mdash;a winter-piece,
with an ass and her foal standing near an old outhouse,&mdash;cannot be
properly represented without lowering the block; for no overlaying would
cause the lines indicating the thatch on the houses and the stacks, as
seen through the snow, to appear so soft as they now do.</p>

<p class = "illustration">

<p>In this cut of a Salmon Trout, with a view of Bywell Lock, on the
river Tyne, both the fore-ground and the distance are lowered; the
objects which appear comparatively dark in those parts are the least
reduced, while those that appear lightest are such as are lowered to the
greatest extent. The back of the fish, which appears dark in the
impression, is in the block like a ridge, which is gradually lowered in
a hollow curve towards the lower line. In such a cut as this, particular
care ought to be taken not to lower too much those parts which come into
immediate contact with a strong black outline, such as the back of the
Salmon; for where the lowering in such parts is too abrupt, there is
great risk of the lines engraved on them not being <i>brought up</i>,
and thus causing the figure in relief to appear surrounded with a white
line, as in the impressions from the crown-piece at page 618.</p>

<p>By means of lowering, the black pony, on which a boy is seen riding,
in the following cut, is much more effectively represented, than if the
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page624" id = "page624">
624</a></span>
whole subject were engraved on a plane surface. The grey horse, and the
light jacket of the rider, the ground, the garden wall, and the lightest
of the trees, are all lowered in order to give greater effect to the
pony.</p>

<p class = "illustration">
<a name = "illus_624a" id = "illus_624a">&nbsp;</a>

<p>A cut which is properly lowered may not only be printed by a
steam-press without overlays, but will also afford a much greater number
of good impressions than one of the same kind engraved on a plane
surface; for the more delicate parts, being lower than those adjacent to
them, are thus saved from too much pressure, without the necessity of
increasing it in other places. The preceding cut will serve to show
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page625" id = "page625">
625</a></span>
the advantages of lowering in this respect. It was originally engraved,
from a drawing by William Harvey, for the Treatise on Cattle, published
under the direction of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful
Knowledge. Though twelve thousand impressions have already been printed
from it by means of Messrs. Clowes and Sons’ steam-press, it has not
sustained the slightest injury in any part; and the present impression
is scarcely inferior to the first proof. With the exception of clearing
out the ink in two or three places, it has required no preparation or
retouching to give it its present appearance. Had such a work as the
Treatise on Cattle been printed at a common press without the blocks
having been lowered, the cost of printing would have been at least
double the sum charged by Messrs. Clowes; and the engraving, after so
great a number of impressions had been taken, would have been
considerably injured, if not quite spoiled.</p>

<p>In complicated subjects, consisting of many figures, and in which the
light and shade are much diversified, it becomes necessary to combine
the two principles of lowering, which have been separately illustrated
by the Dog and the Egret, and to adapt them according to circumstances,
forming some parts convex, and making others concave, respectively, as
the objects engraved on them are to appear dark or light. In order to
illustrate this process of combined lowering, I&nbsp;have chosen a
subject from Rembrandt&mdash;the Descent from the Cross&mdash;in which
several figures are introduced, and in which the lights and shades are
so much varied&mdash;in some parts blended by a delicate middle tint,
and in others strongly contrasted&mdash;as to afford the greatest
possible scope for the illustration of what is termed <i>lowering</i> in
a wood engraving.</p>

<p>The cut on the next page shows the appearance of an impression taken
from the block before a single line had been engraved, except the
<i>white</i> outline bounding the figures. All that is here seen has
been effected by the flat tool and the scraper; the lightest parts are
those that are most concave, the darkest those that are most convex. The
parts which have the appearance of a middle tint are such as are reduced
to a medium between the strongest light and the darkest shade. The
impression in its present state has very much the appearance of an
unfinished mezzotint.</p>

<p class = "illustration">
<a name = "illus_626" id = "illus_626">&nbsp;</a>
<img src = "images/illus_626.png" width = "328" height = "437"

<p>In order to render this example of complicated lowering more
intelligible to those who have little knowledge of the subject, it seems
necessary to give a detailed account of the process, even at the risk of
repeating some previous explanations. In complicated as well as in
simple subjects intended to be lowered, the design is first drawn in
outline on the wood. In such a subject as that which is here given, the
Descent from the Cross, it is necessary to cut a delicate <i>white</i>
outline&mdash;such as is seen in the ladder&mdash;round all those parts
where the true
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page626" id = "page626">
626</a></span>
outline appears dark against light, previous to lowering out those light
parts which come into immediate contact with such as are dark. When a
white outline has been cut where required, a&nbsp;thin shaving is to be
taken off those parts which are intended to be a shade lighter than the
middle tints,&mdash;for instance, in the rays of light falling upon the
cross, and in the lower part of the sky. After this, the light parts of
the ground and the figures are to be lowered; but, instead of taking a
mere shaving off the latter, the depth to which they are to be hollowed
out will depend on the form and size of the parts, and the strength of
the light intended to appear on them; and where a series of delicate
lines are to run into <i>pure white</i>, great care must be taken that
the wood be sufficiently <i>bevelled</i> or rounded off to allow of
their blending with the white, without their extremities forming a
distinct line, more especially where rotundity is to be represented. In
a block thus lowered, the parts intended to be lightest will be the most
concave, and those intended to be darkest the most in relief; and, when
printed, the
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page627" id = "page627">
627</a></span>
impression will appear as in the following cut, in consequence of the
lowered parts, in proportion to their depth, receiving both less ink and
less pressure; while those that are to appear positively white are
lowered to such an extent as to be neither touched by the ink, nor
exposed to the action of the platten or cylinder.</p>

<p class = "illustration">
<a name = "illus_627" id = "illus_627">&nbsp;</a>
<img src = "images/illus_627.png" width = "333" height = "439"
alt = "see text"></p>

<p>When the block has been thus prepared, the subject is drawn upon it
in detail, and the engraving of the lines proceeded with. The sky, and
the lighter and more distant objects, should be engraved first: and care
ought to be taken not to get the lines too fine at the commencement,
for, should this happen, there is no remedy for the defect. By keeping
them comparatively strong, the darker objects can be executed in a
corresponding degree of boldness; and should the proof be generally too
dark, the necessary alterations can be easily made. The above cut of the
Descent from the Cross is printed from the finished block; all the
positive lines here seen having been engraved subsequent to the process
of lowering.</p>

<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page628" id = "page628">
628</a></span>
<p>It is necessary to observe that the process of engraving upon an
uneven surface&mdash;such as that of the lowered block of the Descent
from the Cross&mdash;is much more difficult than on a surface which is
perfectly plane; for the graver in traversing such parts as are lowered
is apt to lose its hold, and to slip in descending, while in ascending
it is liable to take too much hold, and to <i>tear</i> rather than to
clearly cut out the wood in certain parts, thus rendering the raised
lines rough at the sides, and sometimes breaking them quite through. In
order to remedy in some degree such inconveniences, it is necessary to
use a graver slightly curving upwards towards the point.</p>

<p>The process of lowering, as previously explained, is peculiarly
adapted to give the appearance of proper texture to objects of Natural
History, and in particular to birds, where it is often so desirable to
impart a soft downy appearance to the plumage. Such softness can never
be well represented by lines engraved on a perfectly level surface; for,
however thin and fine they may be, they will always appear too distinct,
and want that softness which can only be obtained by lowering the block,
and printing it with a blanket in the tympans at a common press. Those
who in engraving birds on a plane surface are fond of imitating the
delicacy of copper-plate or steel engravings, always fail in their
attempts to represent that soft appearance so peculiar to the plumage of
birds, whatever may be its colour. Bewick’s Birds, in this respect, have
never been equalled; and the softness displayed in the plumage has been
chiefly obtained by lowering, and thus preventing such parts receiving
too much ink or too much pressure. The characteristic expression of the
bird, and the variety of texture in the plumage, are not indeed entirely
dependent on this process; but the appearance of softness, and the
general effect of the cut as a whole,&mdash;as exemplified in the Birds
of Bewick,&mdash;are not otherwise to be obtained. Any wood engraver who
doubts this, should attempt to copy, on an unlowered block, one of the
best of Bewick’s birds; on comparing a printed impression of his work
with the original, he will be likely to discover that he has thought too
highly of his own practice, and too lightly of Bewick’s.</p>

<p>Though chiaro-scuro drawings can be faithfully copied by means of
wood engraving; yet the art, as applied to the execution of such works,
has met with but little encouragement in this country, and has
consequently been little practised. From 1754&mdash;the date of
J.&nbsp;B. Jackson’s tract on the Invention of Engraving and Printing in
Chiaro-scuro&mdash;to 1819, when the first part of Mr. Savage’s Hints on
Decorative Printing was published, the only chiaro-scuro wood engravings
which appear to have been published in England were those executed about
1783, by an amateur of the name of John Skippe. The chiaro-scuros
engraved by
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page629" id = "page629">
629</a></span>
Mr. Skippe do not appear to have been numerous; I&nbsp;have only seen
three&mdash;St. John the Evangelist, St. Paul, and Hebe, all after
drawings by Parmegiano. The latter is printed from four blocks, and each
of the others from three. In point of execution, that of St. John is
decidedly the best: it is much superior to any of the specimens given in
J.&nbsp;B. Jackson’s work, and will bear a comparison with some of the
best chiaro-scuros of Nicholas Le Sueur.</p>

<p>Savage’s Hints on Decorative Printing, in two parts, 1819-1823,
contains several specimens, not only of chiaro-scuro wood engravings,
but also of subjects printed in positive colours from several
wood-blocks, in imitation of coloured drawings. Some of the
chiaro-scuros, properly so called, are well executed, though they
generally seem too soft and <i>woolly</i>. The following are those which
seem most worthy of notice:&mdash;A female Bacchante, from a bas-relief
in the British Museum; Theseus, from the statue in the Elgin Collection
of Marbles, in the British Museum; Copy of a bust in marble in the
British Museum; Bridge and Landscape; Passage-boats; and a River Scene.
For the representation of such subjects as the preceding, when drawn in
sepia, wood engraving is peculiarly adapted.</p>

<p>The simplest manner of representing a chiaro-scuro drawing is by
printing a tint, with the lights cut out, from a second block, over the
impression of a cut engraved in the usual manner. Chiaro-scuros of this
kind have the appearance of pen-and-ink drawings made on tinted paper,
and heightened with touches of white. The illustrations to an edition of
Puckle’s Club were thus printed in 1820,&mdash;the year after they had
appeared printed in the usual manner in a new edition of the
work&mdash;but many of them are spoiled by the badly-chosen “fancy”
colour of the tint.</p>

<p>From the time of the publication of the second part of Savage’s
Hints, and the tinted illustrations of Puckle’s Club, no further
attempts appear to have been made to improve or extend the practice of
chiaro-scuro engraving and printing in colours till Mr. George Baxter
turned his attention to the subject. His first attempts in chiaro-scuro
engraving are to be found in a History of Sussex, printed by his father
at Lewes, in 1835. Mr. Baxter tried various experiments, and at length
succeeded so much to his satisfaction, that he took out a patent for
printing in oil-colours. The manner in which he executes picture-prints
in positive colours, after drawings or paintings in oil, is
<i>nearly</i> the same as that in which Kirkall executed his
chiaro-scuros. The ground, the outlines, and the more minute details,
are first printed in neutral tint from a plate engraved in aquatint; and
over this impression the proper colours are printed from as many
wood-blocks as there are different tints. The best specimens of Mr.
Baxter’s printing in oil-colours, from wood-blocks over
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page630" id = "page630">
630</a></span>
an aquatint ground, are to be found in the Pictorial Album, published by
Chapman and Hall, 1837; and among these the following appear to be most
deserving of distinct enumeration:&mdash;Interior of the Lady Chapel,
Warwick; Lugano; Verona; and Jeannie Deans’s Interview with the Queen.
In some of the most elaborate subjects in this work, the colours have
been communicated by not less than twenty blocks, each separately
printed. So far as regards the landscapes, nothing of the same kind
previously done will bear to be compared with them. But since this
period, Mr. Baxter has brought his peculiar art to still greater
perfection, and both large and small examples are to be met with
abundantly. One of the most popular is his “Holy Trinity, after
Raphael,” a&nbsp;small plate of which no fewer than 700,000 copies have
been sold. The subscribers to Bohn’s Scientific Library will find a good
specimen in the View of Chimborazo, prefixed to Humboldt’s Views of
Nature.</p>

<p>Another recent invention is that of “Knight’s Patent Illuminated
Prints and Maps.” In every instance hitherto of surface-printing in
colours, each colour, having a separate block, had to be worked off
separately, which rendered such productions extremely expensive.<a class
= "tag" name = "tagIX28" id = "tagIX28" href = "#noteIX28">IX.28</a> The
new process has one great advantage over all its predecessors, in
cheapness, and the facility with which it can multiply impressions. The
general nature of the process will be best understood from a description
of the mode of completing a coloured print.</p>

<p>In the first place, a subject is engraved upon wood in the usual
manner, and the impression is coloured by a skilful artist. We will
suppose four principal colours are introduced, red, blue, yellow, and
brown. Separate and exact drawings of each colour are then made; and
four polished plates are prepared, each plate carrying one colour. These
four plates are then firmly fixed in an ingeniously contrived frame, or
table, moving upon the table of a common press, the motion being
regulated by machinery, which ensures the most exact register, after it
has once been obtained, and affords the greatest facility in obtaining
it. The colours are then applied to their respective plates in precisely
the same manner as ink to type, by means of rollers; and four sheets of
paper of the size intended for the print (or,&nbsp;for convenience, one
large sheet to be afterwards cut&nbsp;up) are then placed on the
frisket, which
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page631" id = "page631">
631</a></span>
is then turned down on the plates, and the pull applied. The table is
then turned one quarter round, and the process is repeated, till each
colour has, in succession, been printed upon the four sheets. Six or
seven colours are sometimes produced by the same process, and from the
same plates, by combination; and the union of two colours to produce a
third is effected perfectly, in consequence of the rapidity of the
process, which does not allow the colours to dry and become hard. The
bright whites are, of course, formed by removing the surface in the
requisite parts from all the plates, and suffering the ground to appear.
Eight, or indeed any number of colours, can be introduced by using
another press, or presses; in which case the frisket with the sheet or
sheets fixed, is passed from one press to the other. The block of the
drawing is always the last impressed.</p>

<p>From its extreme exactitude this invention seems peculiarly adapted
for designs of patterns for shawls, ribbons, printed cottons, carpets,
and such manufactures as have hitherto apparently been left to the fancy
of the workman, or his employers, who in matters of art have frequently
quite as little taste as the workman.</p>

<p>But probably the most favourable field for the display of the
perfections of this invention, would be in subjects where only light and
shade, or at most what are called neutral tints, are required, such as
architectural drawings and sculptures, either statues or in relief. For
such purposes the depth of tone obtainable, and the sharpness of the
lights, seem peculiarly adapted.<a class = "tag" name = "tagIX29" id =
"tagIX29" href = "#noteIX29">IX.29</a></p>

<p>What is termed metallic relief engraving consists in executing
subjects on plates of copper, or any other metal, in such a manner that
the lines which form the impression shall be in relief, and thus allow
of such plates being inked and printed in the same manner as a wood-cut.
Since the revival of wood engraving in this country several attempts
have been made to <i>etch</i> in metallic relief, and thus save the time
necessarily required to cut out all the lines in a wood engraving. In
etching upon copper, in order that the subject may be represented by
lines <i>in relief</i>,&mdash;the reverse of the usual procedure in
copper-plate engraving,&mdash;and that the plate may be printed in the
same manner as a wood-cut, there are several methods of proceeding. In
one, the subject is <i>drawn</i> upon the plate in Burgundy pitch, or
any other substance which will resist the action of aquafortis, in the
same manner
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page632" id = "page632">
632</a></span>
as copper-plate engravers in the ordinary process <i>stop out</i> the
parts intended to be white. When the substance in which the drawing is
made becomes <i>set</i>, or sufficiently hard, the plate is surrounded
with a <i>wall</i>, as it is technically termed, and aquafortis being
poured upon it, all the unprotected parts are corroded, and the drawing
left in relief.</p>

<p>This was the method generally adopted by William Blake, an artist of
great but eccentric genius, in the execution of his Songs of Innocence,
the Book of Thel,<a class = "tag" name = "tagIX30" id = "tagIX30" href =
"#noteIX30">IX.30</a> the Gates of Paradise, Urizen, and other works,
published between 1789 and 1800. The following account of the origin of
this new mode of engraving or etching in metallic relief, by corroding
the parts intended to appear white in the impression, is extracted from
the Life of William Blake, in Allan Cunningham’s Lives of British
Painters, Sculptors, and Architects:&mdash;</p>

<p>“He had made the sixty-five designs of his Songs of Innocence, and
was meditating, he said, on the best means of multiplying their
resemblance in form and in hue; he felt sorely perplexed. At last he was
made aware that the spirit of his favourite brother Robert was in the
room, and to this celestial visitor he applied for counsel. The spirit
advised him at once: ‘Write,’ he said, ‘the poetry, and draw the designs
upon the copper, with a certain liquid, (which he named, and which Blake
ever kept a secret,) then cut the plain parts of the plate down with
aquafortis, and this will give the whole, both poetry and figures, in
the manner of stereotype.’ The plan recommended by this gracious spirit
was adopted, the plates were engraved, and the work printed off. The
artist then added a peculiar beauty of his own: he tinted both the
figures and the verse with a variety of colours, amongst which, while
yellow prevails, the whole has a rich and lustrous beauty, to which I
know little that can be compared. The size of these prints is four and a
half inches high by three inches wide. The original genius of Blake was
always confined, through poverty, to small dimensions. Sixty-five plates
of copper were an object to him who had little money.”</p>

<p>Blake subsequently executed, in the same manner, “the Gates of
Paradise,” consisting of sixteen small designs; and “Urizen,” consisting
of twenty-seven designs. The size of the latter is four inches by six,
and they are dated Lambeth, 1794. In 1800 he also engraved by a similar
process, combined with the usual mode of etching <i>through</i> a
prepared ground laid over the plate, two subjects to illustrate a song
of his own writing, which was printed with them also from metallic
relief. The title of this song is “Little Tom the Sailor,” and the date
is October 5, 1800. It appears to have been a charitable contribution
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page633" id = "page633">
633</a></span>
of Blake’s to the “Widow Spicer of Folkstone,” the mother of little Tom;
and we learn from the imprint at the bottom that it was printed for, and
sold by her for the benefit of her orphans.</p>

<p>Blake’s metallic relief engravings were printed by himself by means
of a rolling or copper-plate press, though the impression was obtained
from the lines in relief in the same manner as from a wood-cut. The only
difference in the printing consisted in the different manner in which
the pressure was applied. As it is difficult, according to Blake’s
process, to corrode the large white parts to a depth sufficient to
prevent their being touched by the dauber or ball in the process of
inking, and thus presenting a soiled appearance in the impression, he
was accustomed to wipe the ink out where it had touched in the hollows.
As this occupied more time than the mere inking of the plate, his
progress in printing was necessarily slow.</p>

<p>In another mode of engraving in relief on a plate of copper, the
plate is first covered with an etching ground in the usual manner, and
to this ground an outline of the subject is transferred by passing the
plate with a pencil-drawing above it through a rolling-press. The
engraver then proceeds to remove with his etching-point, or some other
tool, as may be necessary, all such parts as are intended to be
<i>white</i>. When this process, which may be termed <i>reverse
etching</i>, is completed, the parts intended to be white are corroded
by pouring aquafortis upon the plate in the usual manner, while the
lines which represent the object remain in relief, in consequence of
their being protected at the surface by the coating of etching
ground.</p>

<p>Several persons have made experiments in this mode of metallic relief
engraving. It was tried by Bewick, and also by the late Robert Branston;
but they did not succeed to their satisfaction, and none of their
productions executed in this manner was ever submitted to the public.
About twenty years ago, Mr. W.&nbsp;Lizars of Edinburgh appears to have
turned his attention to the subject of metallic relief engraving, and to
have succeeded better than either Bewick or Branston. One of the
earliest-published specimens of his engraving in this style is the
portrait of Dr. Peter Morris, forming the frontispiece to Peter’s
Letters to his Kinsfolk, printed at Edinburgh in 1819. This portrait has
every appearance of being executed by the process of reverse
etching,&mdash;that is, by first covering the plate with etching ground,
and then removing the parts that are to be white, and leaving the lines
that are to appear black in relief. The plate was printed by a common
printing-press at the office of Ballantyne and Co. In the preface the
“new invention” of Mr. Lizars is thus mentioned:&mdash;“The portrait of
Dr. Morris is done in this new style; and, had the time permitted, the
others would have all been done so likewise. It is thrown off by the
common printing-press, as the
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page634" id = "page634">
634</a></span>
reader will observe&mdash;but this is only one of the distinguishing
excellences of this new and splendid invention of Mr. Lizars.”</p>

<p>Within the last three or four years several plans for executing
engravings in metallic relief have been devised; and it has been
prophesied of each, that it would in a short time totally supersede wood
engraving. The projectors of those plans, however, seem to have taken
too narrow a view of the subject; and to have thought that the mere
novelty of their invention was sufficient to ensure it success. They
appear not to have considered, that it was necessary that their metallic
relief casts should not only be cheaper than wood-cuts, but that they
should be also as well executed.</p>

<p>Mr. Woone has taken out a patent for his invention, and the principle
upon which it is founded is that of taking a cast from a copper-plate,
whereby the lines engraved in <i>intaglio</i> are in the cast in
<i>relief</i>. His process of metallic relief engraving is as
follows:&mdash;A smooth plate of metal is covered with a coating of
plaster of Paris, about equal in thickness to the depth to which the
lines are cut in engraving on copper or steel. Upon this surface of
plaster the engraver, with a fine point, as in etching, cuts the lines
of the subject <i>through</i> to the plate below. When this plaster
etching is completed, a&nbsp;cast is taken from it in type-metal; and,
after being <i>cleared out</i>, the subject in metallic relief can be
printed at a common press in the manner of a wood-cut. According to this
plan only <i>one</i> cast can be taken of each subject, as the plaster
is destroyed during the process, so that there is nothing left from
which a second mould can be made, as in the case of a wood-cut. The
chief advantage of this invention consists in the lines being of equal
height in the cast, in consequence of their being etched through the
plaster to the level surface of the plate beneath. As the coating of
plaster is, however, extremely thin, it is generally necessary to clear
out with a graver the interstices of the cast in order to prevent their
being touched by the inking roller.</p>

<p>A Mr. Schonberg has also made several experiments in metallic relief
engraving by means of etching on stone, and afterwards taking a cast
from his work. Though he has been for several years endeavouring to
perfect his invention, he has not up to this time succeeded in producing
anything which it would be fair to criticise.</p>

<p>Many of the cuts of trees and shrubs in Loudon’s Arboretum et
Fruticetum Britannicum are printed from casts in metallic relief,
executed by Mr. Robert Branston. The mode of procedure, according to Mr.
Branston’s method, is extremely simple; the subject is first etched on
copper, and bit in by aquafortis in the usual manner; and from this
etching a cast is afterwards taken in type-metal. As the plate is not
corroded to an equal depth in every part, it is necessary to rub on a
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page635" id = "page635">
635</a></span>
stone the faces of the casts thus obtained in order to reduce the raised
lines to the same level. There is also another inconvenience that
attends casts in metallic relief taken from an etched copper-plate; for,
as the aquafortis acts laterally as well as vertically, it is difficult
to corrode the lines to a sufficient depth, without at the same time
getting them too thick. It is hence necessary to clear out many of the
hollow parts of such casts with a graver, in order to prevent their
being touched by the balls or inking-roller, and thus giving to the
impression a soiled appearance.</p>

<p>Casts in metallic relief from etchings always appear coarse; and,
from the experiments hitherto made, it seems impossible to execute
<i>fine</i> work in this manner. So far as relates to cheapness, such
casts, however well they may be executed, being of a level surface,
cannot be printed properly by a steam-press in the manner of lowered
blocks, or casts from lowered blocks. For a work of extensive
circulation, printed by means of a steam-press, a&nbsp;lowered block, or
a cast from it, would be cheaper at five pounds, than a cast from an
etching at four, even admitting that both were equally well
executed.</p>

<p>The principal feature in Mr. C. Hancock’s patent metallic relief
engraving, which is quite original, is, that subjects resembling
mezzotints can be inserted and printed with the text in the same manner
as wood engravings. A&nbsp;mezzotint plate, if printed in the usual
manner previous to being engraved upon, would appear black. On the other
hand, if submitted to the same kind of printing as a wood-cut, it would
scarcely discolour the paper. Upon this plate Mr. Hancock draws his
subject with a broad steel point or burnisher, which polishes down the
small prominences to a smooth surface in proportion to the pressure used
in drawing. In proportion as the surface becomes smooth, so does it
print dark, and have the appearance of a mezzotint. The reader will
perceive that, according to this plan, Mr. Hancock can take a proof of
his subject at any time, and procure either <i>dark</i> or <i>light</i>
at pleasure, as the subject may appear to require it. The sparkling
light can be touched in with the graver, in the same manner as on wood;
so that such touches appear much sharper than in common mezzotint, where
the lights are got by burnishing. As Mr. Hancock has not as yet brought
anything before the public, it would be unfair to anticipate him, by
introducing anything more in this place than a description of his
process.</p>

<p>Wood engraving is necessarily confined, by the size of the wood, to
the execution of subjects of comparatively small dimensions; and this
limitation, together with the difficulty of printing even tints in
positive colours, have combined to prevent it from being made
extensively available in the production of works in chiaro-scuro, of
large size, by the ordinary modes of surface-printing. Latterly,
however,
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page636" id = "page636">
636</a></span>
the demand which the progress of education has created for maps, school
prints, elementary examples of fine art, and illustrations <i>on a large
scale</i> for the illustrated newspapers, having called the attention of
artists to the subject, many attempts have been made, and in some cases
with success, to produce relief engravings on metal; and also to combine
that mode of engraving with analogous apparatus for the production of
works in tints or colours, separate, combined, or mixed with line
plates, in such degrees as particular cases might require. Several of
these persons have been already named, and their processes described; it
only therefore remains to state, that Mr. Stephen Sly, in connexion with
other artists, has for some years past been steadily engaged in making a
series of experiments for giving a practical value, by various
inventions, to the discoveries and experience of their predecessors in
the art; and with every prospect of success. Their method of procedure
is: 1.&nbsp;To produce a finished drawing, in simple or crossed lines,
with etching varnish on a plate prepared for the purpose; 2.&nbsp;To
bite away, with a compound acid, the spaces between the varnish lines;
and 3.&nbsp;To deepen and finish the work so produced, by the use of
engraving tools, in the ordinary manner. The great difficulties in the
way of these apparently simple operations have been, 1.&nbsp;To cast
<i>sound</i> and durable plates of a large size, and of a texture
sufficiently compact to produce sharp lines by the etching process, and
at the same time soft enough to permit the surfaces to be lowered, and
the cutting to be executed with facility; 2.&nbsp;To remove the oxide
formed by the combination of the acid with the metal from between the
lines; and 3.&nbsp;To carry the biting to a depth sufficiently great to
permit the plate, with the addition of a small quantity of graver-work,
to yield a clear impression.</p>

<p>Metallic relief engraving has not unfrequently been practised at
Paris of late years. I&nbsp;have now lying before me an impression from
a plate engraved in this manner by Messrs. Best, Andrew, and Leloir, of
that city. The subject is a wild turkey, and it was engraved about three
years ago for Mr. Audubon. Though it is the best specimen of metallic
relief engraving that has come under my notice, I&nbsp;am yet of opinion
that the subject could be better engraved on wood, and at a less cost.
Ornaments and borders are sometimes engraved on solid brass by means of
chisels and gravers in the same manner as a wood-cut. The head of
Buchanan, and the border on the wrapper of Blackwood’s Magazine, were
engraved on brass in this manner, more than twenty years ago, by Messrs.
<ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘Vizitelly’">Vizetelly</ins>, Branston, and Co. They were originally
engraved on wood by Bewick. The greater durability of ornaments engraved
on brass, compensates for their additional cost. The <i>cheapest</i>
mode, however, is to have such ornaments first engraved on wood, and
casts afterwards taken from them in type metal. One great objection to
<i>cutting</i>
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page637" id = "page637">
637</a></span>
on metal with the graver is, that the metal <i>cuts the paper</i> in
printing from it.</p>

<p>Duplicates of wood engravings may be readily obtained by means of
casts from the original blocks; and within the last twenty years, the
practice of thus multiplying subjects originally engraved on wood, has
become very prevalent both in this country and in France. Casts can be
obtained from wood engravings by two different processes, and both are
practised by two or three stereotype printers, to whom this business is
usually entrusted. By the one mode, a&nbsp;mould is first made from the
block in plaster of Paris, and from this mould or matrix a cast is
afterwards taken in type metal. By the other mode&mdash;termed by the
French <i>clichage</i><a class = "tag" name = "tagIX31" id = "tagIX31"
href = "#noteIX31">IX.31</a>&mdash;the mould or matrix is not formed of
plaster; but is obtained by letting the block fall, with its engraved
surface downwards, directly on a mass of metal,<a class = "tag" name =
"tagIX32" id = "tagIX32" href = "#noteIX32">IX.32</a> just sufficiently
fluid to receive the impression, and which becomes solid almost at the
very instant it is touched by the block. From this mould or matrix a
cast is afterwards taken in the same manner. In order to prevent the
surface of the block becoming charred by the heat, it is previously
rubbed over with a composition of common yellow soap and red ochre.</p>

<p>When it is particularly desirable to preserve the original block
uninjured, the safest mode is that of forming a mould or matrix of
plaster; for by the process of <i>clichage</i> a delicately engraved
block is extremely
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page638" id = "page638">
638</a></span>
liable to receive damage. As a cast, whether from a matrix of metal or
of plaster, generally requires certain small specks of the metal to be
removed, or some of the lines to be cleared out, this operation is
frequently entrusted to a person employed in a printing-office where
such cast is taken. Such person, however, should never be allowed to do
more than remove the specks; for, should he attempt to re-enter or
re-cut the lines or tints on metal, he will be very likely to spoil the
work. It is extremely difficult, even to a dexterous engraver, to
re-enter the lines that have been partially closed up in a tint, so that
they shall appear the same as the others which have come off clear.
Should the printer’s <i>picker</i> happen to re-enter them in a
direction opposite to that in which they were originally cut on the
block, the work is certain to be spoiled. When a cast requires clearing
out and retouching in this manner, the operation ought to be performed
by a wood engraver, and, if possible, by the person who executed the
original block. When the subject is not very complicated, it is
extremely difficult to distinguish which of two impressions is from a
cast, and which is from the original block. Those who profess to have
great judgment in such matters are left to determine which of the
preceding busts is printed from metal, and which from wood.</p>

<p>When a duplicate of a modern, or a fac-simile of an old wood-cut is
required, the best mode of obtaining a correct copy, is to transfer the
original, if not too large or too valuable, to a prepared block; and the
mode of effecting this is as follows:&mdash;The back of the impression
to be transferred is first well moistened with a mixture composed of
equal parts of concentrated potash and essence of lavender; it is then
placed above a block whose surface has been slightly moistened with
water, and rubbed with a burnisher. If the mixture be of proper
strength, the ink of the old impression will become loosened, and be
transferred to the wood. Recent impression of a wood-cut, before the ink
is set, may be transferred to a block without any preparation, merely by
what is technically termed “rubbing down.” In order to transfer
impressions from copper-plates, it is necessary to use the <i>oil</i> of
lavender instead of the <i>essence</i>: if a very old impression, apply
the preparation to its face.</p>

<p>Since the former edition of this work considerable improvements have
been made in the mode of taking casts, of which the principal is
<i>electrotyping</i>, by the galvanic precipitation of copper. By this
process all the finer lines of the engraving are so perfectly preserved,
that impressions printed from the cast are quite undistinguishable from
those printed from the original block.</p>

<p>Before closing this subject we think it right to introduce the notice
of a new art, which, if it accomplishes all it professes, and as,
judging by the annexed example, it seems capable of performing, will be
a great acquisition.
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page639" id = "page639">
639</a></span>
The art was first brought out as Collins’s process, but is now called
the <i>Electro-printing Block process</i>, and is managed under the
inventor’s direction by a company established at No.&nbsp;27, New Bridge
Street, Blackfriars. The object of the process is to reduce or extend,
by means of transfer to an elastic material, maps or engravings of any
size. The specimen given in the present volume is reduced from a
lithograph copy of an early block print, four times its size,<a class =
"tag" name = "tagIX33" id = "tagIX33" href = "#noteIX33">IX.33</a> and
then electrotyped
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page640" id = "page640">
640</a></span>
into a surface block, so as to print in the ordinary manner of a
wood-engraving. The reader will easily imagine that any plate
transferred to an elastic surface distended equally, will, when
collapsed, yield a reduced impression, and <i>vice versâ</i>. The only
drawback to this process seems to be the want of depth in the
electro-type where there are large unengraved spaces. Such plates will
want good bringing-up and very careful printing.</p>

<p>The unequal manner in which wood-cuts are printed, is often injurious
both to publishers and engravers; for, however well a subject may have
been engraved, or whatever may have been the expense incurred, both the
engraver’s talents and the publisher’s money will, in a great measure,
have been thrown away unless the cut be properly printed. The want of
cordial co-operation between printers and wood engravers is one of the
chief causes of wood-cuts being so frequently printed in an improper
manner. One printer’s method of printing wood-cuts often differs so much
from that of another, that it is generally necessary for an engraver who
wishes to have justice done to his work, to ascertain the office at
which a book is to be printed before he begins to execute any of the
cuts. If they are intended to be printed at a steam-press, they require
to be engraved in a manner suitable to that method of printing; and if
it be further intended to take casts from them, and to print from such
casts instead of the original blocks, it is necessary for the engraver
to execute his work accordingly. Should they have to be printed at a
common press <i>with a blanket</i>, it is necessary that they should be
lowered in such parts as are most liable to be printed too heavy from
the parchment of the tympan, when there is a blanket behind it,
penetrating to a greater depth between the lines than when no blanket is
used.<a class = "tag" name = "tagIX34" id = "tagIX34" href =
"#noteIX34">IX.34</a> When it is intended to print cuts in what is
called the <i>best</i> manner,&mdash;that is, at a common press without
a blanket, and where the effect is brought up by means of
overlaying,&mdash;the engraver has nothing to do but to execute his
subject on a plane surface to the best of his ability, and to leave the
task of bringing up the dark, and easing the light parts to the
printer,&mdash;who, if he have not an artist’s eye, can only by chance
succeed in producing the effect intended by the draftsman and the
engraver.</p>

<p>Should a series of wood-cuts be engraved with the view of their being
printed at a steam-press, or at a common press with a blanket, and
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page641" id = "page641">
641</a></span>
should the publisher or proprietor of the work afterwards change his
intention, and decide on having them printed in the <i>best</i>
manner,&mdash;that is, by the common press without a blanket, and with
overlays,&mdash;such cuts, whatever pains might be taken, could not be
properly and efficiently printed; for those parts which had been lowered
in order to obviate the <i>in</i>-pressure of the blanket, would either
be totally invisible, or would only appear imperfectly,&mdash;that is,
with the lines indistinct and broken, as if they had not been properly
inked. The following cut, which was lowered for machine-printing, or
printing with a blanket, but has been worked off at a common press
without a blanket, when compared with the same subject printed in the
manner originally intended,&mdash;that is, with a blanket,&mdash;will
illustrate what has been previously said on the subject. I&nbsp;by no
means wish it to be understood, that any printer would allow such a cut
to appear quite so bad as it does in the present impression; he would do
<i>something</i> to remedy the defects, but he could not, without
employing a blanket, cause it to have the appearance originally intended
by the designer and engraver. It is printed here without any aid of
overlaying, in order that the difference might be the more apparent to
those who are unacquainted with the subject. I&nbsp;have, however, not
unfrequently seen excellent cuts spoiled from inattention to bringing up
the lowered parts, even when printed at the office of printers who have
acquired a high character for <i>fine</i> work, and whose names on this
account are announced in advertisements in connexion with those of the
author, designer, and publisher, as a
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page642" id = "page642">
642</a></span>
guarantee for the superior manner in which the cuts contained in the
work will be printed.<a class = "tag" name = "tagIX35" id = "tagIX35"
href = "#noteIX35">IX.35</a> The following cut, of the same subject as
that given on the previous page, shows the appearance of the engraving
when properly printed in the manner intended; every line is here brought
up by using a blanket, while from the block having been lowered, with a
view to its being printed in this manner, there has been no occasion for
overlays to increase the effect in the darker parts. The difference in
the two impressions is entirely owing to the different manner of
printing; for the one is printed from the block, and the other from a
cast.</p>

<p>Subjects engraved on lowered blocks, in the manner of the following
cut, have always an unfinished appearance when printed without a
blanket, and the feebleness and confusion apparent in the lighter parts,
instead of being remedied by overlaying the darker parts, are thus
rendered more obvious. The connecting medium between the extremes of
black and white being either entirely omitted or very imperfectly
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page643" id = "page643">
643</a></span>
given, causes the impression to have that harsh and unfinished
appearance which is frequently urged as one of the greatest objections
to engraving on wood. It is indeed true, that many cuts have this
objectionable appearance; but it is also true that the fault does not
originate in any deficiency in the art, but is either the result of want
of knowledge on the part of the engraver, or is occasioned by improper
printing. When wood engravers found that anything approaching to
delicacy, in blending the extremes of black and white in their work, was
extremely liable to be either lost or spoiled in the printing, it is not
surprising that they should have paid comparatively little attention to
the connecting tints. In many excellently engraved cuts, printed at the
common press with overlays, the tint next in gradation to positive black
is often perceived to be too dark, in consequence of the extra pressure
on the adjacent parts; while, on the other hand, the delicate lines
intended to blend with the white, are either too heavy, or appear broken
and confused. It is chiefly from this cause, that so much black and
white, without the requisite connecting middle tints, is found in
wood-cuts; for the engraver, finding that such tints were frequently
spoiled in the impression, omitted them whenever he could, in order to
adapt his subject to the usual method of printing. When, in consequence
of an improvement in the mode of printing wood-cuts, engravers can
depend on finding all in the impression that can be executed on the
block, it will no longer be an objection to the art that its productions
have a hard and unfinished appearance, and that it is only capable of
efficiently representing subjects displaying strong contrasts of black
and white.</p>

<p>Should a wood-cut engraved on a plane surface, with the intention of
its being printed in the <i>best</i> manner,&mdash;that is, at a common
press with overlays, and <i>without</i> a blanket,&mdash;be printed at a
steam-press, or at a common press <i>with</i> a blanket, it will present
a very different appearance to the engraver’s proof.<a class = "tag"
name = "tagIX36" id = "tagIX36" href = "#noteIX36">IX.36</a> The
following cut, which ought properly to have been printed in the
<i>best</i> manner, is here printed improperly <i>with a blanket</i>,
and the result is anything but satisfactory; the parts which ought to
have been delicately printed are, in consequence of the equality of the
pressure on every part of the unlowered surface brought up too heavy,
and from their appearing too dark, the effect intended by the designer
and engraver is destroyed. The same cut, when printed at a common press
with overlays, and without a blanket, as originally intended, would have
the light parts relieved, and appear as it does on the following
page.</p>

<p>The want of something like a uniform method of printing wood-cuts,
and the high price charged by printers for what is called fine work,
have operated most injuriously to the progress and extension of wood
engraving. The practice, however, of printing wood-cuts by a
steam-press, or a press of any kind with a cylindrical roller instead of
a platten, seems likely to introduce a general change in the practice of
the art. By the adoption of this cheap and expeditious method of
printing, books containing the very best wood engravings can be afforded
at a much cheaper rate than formerly. As cuts printed in this
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page645" id = "page645">
645</a></span>
manner can receive no adventitious aid from overlays, the wood engraver
is required to finish his work perfectly before it goes out of his
hands, and not to trust to the taste of a pressman for its being
properly printed. The great desideratum in wood engraving is to produce
cuts which can be efficiently printed at the least possible expense;
and, as a means towards this end, it is necessary that cuts should
require the least possible aid from the printer, and be executed in such
manner that, without gross negligence, they will be certain to print
well. The greatest advantage that wood engraving possesses over
engraving on copper or steel is the cheap rate at which its productions
can be printed at one impression, in the same sheet with the
letter-press. To increase, therefore, by an incomplete method of
engraving, the cost of printing wood-cuts, is to abandon the great
vantage ground of the art.</p>

<p>The mode of printing by the common press without a blanket, and of
<i>helping</i> a cut engraved on a plane surface by means of overlays,
is not only much more expensive than printing from a lowered block by
the steam-press, or a common press with a blanket and without
overlaying, but is also much more injurious to the engraving. When a cut
requires to be overlaid<a class = "tag" name = "tagIX37" id = "tagIX37"
href = "#noteIX37">IX.37</a> in order that it may be properly printed,
a&nbsp;piece of paper is first pasted on the tympan, and on this an
impression is taken, which remains as a substratum for the subsequent
overlays. A&nbsp;second impression is next taken, and in this the
pressman cuts out the lighter parts, and notes such as are too
indistinct and require <i>bringing up</i>. He then proceeds to paste
scraps of paper over the corresponding parts in the first impression, on
a sheet of thin paper, either in front or at the back of the parchment
tympan, in order to increase in such parts the pressure of the platten;
and thus continues, sometimes for half a day, pasting scrap over scrap,
until he obtains what he considers a perfect impression.</p>

<p>As the block is originally of the same height as the type, it is
evident that the overlays must very much increase the pressure of the
platten on such parts as they are immediately above. Such increase of
pressure is not only injurious to the engraving, occasionally breaking
down the lines; but it also frequently squeezes the ink from the surface
<i>into</i> the interstices, and causes the impression in such parts to
appear blotted. While a block, with a flat surface, printed in this
manner will scarcely afford five thousand good impressions without
retouching, twenty thousand can be obtained from a lowered block printed
by a steam-press, or by a common press with a blanket and without
overlays;
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page646" id = "page646">
646</a></span>
the darkest parts in a lowered block being no higher than the type, and
not being overlaid, are subject to no unequal pressure to break down the
lines, while the lighter parts being lowered are thus sufficiently
protected. The intervention of the blanket in the latter case not only
brings up the lighter parts, but is also less injurious to the
engraving, than the direct action of the wood or metal platten, with
only the thin cloth and the parchment of the tympans intervening between
it and the surface of the block.</p>

<p>When wood-cuts are printed with overlays, and the paper is knotty,
the engraving is certain to be injured by the knots being indented in
the wood in those parts where the pressure is greatest. When copies of a
work containing wood-cuts are printed on India paper, the engraving is
almost invariably injured, in consequence of the hard knots and pieces
of bark with which such paper abounds, causing indentions in the wood.
The consequence of printing off a certain number of copies of a work on
such paper may be seen in the cut of the Vain Glow-worm, in the second
edition of the first series of Northcote’s Fables: it is covered with
white spots, the result of indentions in the block caused by the knots
and inequalities in bad India paper. Overlays frequently shift if not
well attended to, and cause pressure where it was never intended.</p>

<p>In order that wood engravings should appear to the greatest
advantage, it is necessary that they should be printed on proper paper.
A&nbsp;person not practically acquainted with the subject may easily be
deceived in selecting paper for a work containing wood engravings. There
is a kind of paper, manufactured of coarse material, which, in
consequence of its being pressed, has a smooth appearance, and to the
view seems to be highly suitable for the purpose. As soon, however, as
such paper is wetted previous to printing, its smoothness disappears,
and its imperfections become apparent by the irregular swelling of the
material of which it is composed. Paper intended for printing the best
kind of wood-cuts ought to be even in texture, and this ought to be the
result of good material well manufactured. Paper of this kind will not
appear uneven when wetted, like that which has merely a <i>good face</i>
put upon it by means of extreme pressure. The best mode of testing the
quality of paper is to wet a sheet; however even and smooth it may
appear when dry, its imperfections will be evident when wet, if it be
manufactured of coarse material, and merely pressed smooth.</p>

<p>Paper of unequal thickness, however good the material may be, is
quite unfit for the purpose of printing the best kind of wood
engravings; for, if a sheet be thicker at one end than the other, there
will be a perceptible difference in the strength of the impressions of
the cuts accordingly as they may be printed on the thick or the thin
parts, those
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page647" id = "page647">
647</a></span>
on the latter being light, while those on the former are comparatively
heavy or dark. When it is known that an overlay of the thinnest tissue
paper will make a perceptible difference in an impression, the necessity
of having paper of even texture for the purpose of printing wood-cuts
well is obvious. As there is less chance of inequality of texture in
comparatively thin paper than in thick, the former kind is generally to
be preferred, supposing it to be equally well manufactured.</p>

<p>Mr. Savage, at page 46 of his Hints on Decorative Printing,
recommends that in a sheet which consists entirely of letter-press in
one <i>form</i>,<a class = "tag error" name = "tagIX38" id = "tagIX38"
href = "#noteIX38" title = "footnote tag missing">IX.38</a> and of
letter-press and wood-cuts in the other, the form without cuts should be
worked first. His words are as follow:&mdash;“When there are wood-cuts
in one form, and none in the other, then the form without the cuts ought
to be worked first; as working the cuts last prevents the indention of
the types appearing on the engraving, which would otherwise take place
to its prejudice.”</p>

<p>My opinion on this subject is directly the reverse of Mr. Savage’s,
for, under similar circum&shy;stances, I&nbsp;should advise that the
form containing the cuts should be printed first; and for the following
reason:&mdash;When any parts of a wood-cut require to be printed
light&mdash;whether by lowering the block or by overlaying&mdash;the
pressure in such parts must necessarily be less than on those adjacent.
If then the form containing such cuts be printed first, the paper being
perfectly flat, and without any indentions, all the lines will appear
distinct and continuous, unless the pressman should grossly neglect his
duty. If, on the contrary, the form containing such cuts be printed
last, there is a risk of the lines in the lighter parts appearing broken
and confused, in consequence of the inequality in the surface of the
paper, caused by the indention of the types on the opposite side.
Imperfections of this kind are to be seen in many works containing
wood-cuts; and they are in particular numerous in the Treatise on Cattle
published under the superintendence of the Society for the Diffusion of
Useful Knowledge. In many of the cuts in this work the lines
representing the sky appear discontinuous and broken, and the
imperfections are always according to the kind of type on the other side
of the paper. When both forms contain wood-cuts, I&nbsp;should recommend
that to be first which contains the best. Mr. Savage’s reason,
independent of the preceding objections, is scarcely a good one; for
admitting that the indention of the types of the second form does appear
in the <i>clear</i> and <i>distinct</i> impressions from the cuts in the
first, when the sheet is just taken from the press, are not such
inequalities entirely removed when the sheet is <i>dried</i> and
pressed?</p>

<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page648" id = "page648">
648</a></span>
<p>In order to produce good impressions in printing wood-cuts, much more
depends on the manner in which the subject is treated by the designer,
and on the plate which the cut occupies in a page, than a person
unacquainted with the nicety required in such matters would imagine.
Wood-cuts which are delicately engraved, or which consist chiefly of
outline, are the most difficult to print in a proper manner, in
consequence of their want of dark masses to relieve the pressure in the
more delicate parts, and thus cause them to appear lighter in the
impression. There ought never to be a large portion of light delicate
work in a wood-cut without a few dark parts near to it, which may serve
as stays or props to relieve the pressure. In illustration of what is
here said, I&nbsp;would refer to the cut of King Shahriyár unveiling
Shahrazád, at page 15 of Mr. Lane’s Translation of the Arabian Nights’
Entertainments, where it will be seen, that certain dark parts are
introduced as if at measured distances. It is entirely owing to the
introduction of those dark parts that the pressman has been enabled to
print the cut so well: they not only give by contrast the appearance of
greater delicacy to the lightest parts; but they also serve to relieve
them from that degree of pressure, which, if the cut consisted entirely
of such delicate lines, would most certainly cause them to appear
comparatively thick and heavy. Another instance of the advantage which a
cut derives from its being placed in a certain situation in the page, is
also afforded by the same work. The cut to which I allude is that of the
Return of the Jinnee, at page 47, consisting chiefly of middle tint,
with a pillar of smoke rising up from the ground, and gradually becoming
lighter towards the top. Had this cut been introduced at the head of the
page without any text above it, the light parts would not have appeared
so delicate as they do now when the cut is printed in its present
situation. The top of the cut, where the lines are required to be
lightest, being near to the types, thus receives a support, and is by
them relieved from that degree of pressure which would otherwise cause
the lines to appear heavy. Towards the bottom of the cut, which also
forms the bottom of the page, there are two or three dark figures which
most opportunely afford that necessary degree of support which in the
upper part is derived from the types.</p>

<p>The engraver by whom a cut has been executed is unquestionably the
best person that the printer can apply to for any information as to the
manner in which it ought to be printed, as he alone can be perfectly
acquainted with the <i>state of the block</i>, and with any peculiarity
in the engraving. If any light part should have been lowered to a very
trifling extent, it is sometimes almost impossible that the printer
should perceive such lowered part after the block has been covered with
ink; and hence, notwithstanding the proof which may have been sent by
the engraver as a guide, such a cut is very likely to be worked off, to
the great injury of
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page649" id = "page649">
649</a></span>
the general effect of the subject, without the lowered part being
properly brought up. In order to avoid such an occurrence, which is by
no means unfrequent, it is advisable to send to the engraver a printed
proof of his cut, in order that he may note those parts where the
pressman has failed in obtaining a perfect impression. From the want of
this precaution wood-cuts are but too often badly printed; while at the
same time the engraver is blamed for executing his work imperfectly,
though in reality the defect is entirely occasioned by the cut not being
properly printed.</p>

<p>The best mode of cleaning a block after the engraver has taken his
first proof is to rub it well with a piece of woollen cloth. So long as
anything remains to be done with the graver, the block, after taking a
proof, ought never to be cleaned with any liquid, as by such means the
ink on the surface would be dissolved, and the mixture getting between,
the lines would thus cause the cut to appear uniformly black, and render
it difficult for the engraver to finish his work in a proper manner from
his inability to clearly distinguish the lines.<a class = "tag" name =
"tagIX39" id = "tagIX39" href = "#noteIX39">IX.39</a> Turpentine or lye
ought to be very sparingly used to clean a cut after the printing is
finished, and never unless the interstices be choked up with ink which
cannot otherwise be removed. When the surface of the block becomes foul,
in consequence of the ink becoming hardened upon it, it is most
advisable to clean it with a little soap and water, using as little
water as possible, and afterwards to rub the block well with a piece of
woollen cloth. When it is necessary to use turpentine in order to get
the hardened ink out of the interstices, the surface of the block should
immediately afterwards be slightly washed with a little soap and water,
and afterwards rubbed with a piece of woollen cloth.<a class = "tag"
name = "tagIX40" id = "tagIX40" href = "#noteIX40">IX.40</a> <i>Warm</i>
water ought never to be used, as it is much more apt than cold to cause
the block to warp and split. The practice of cleaning wood-cuts in the
form by means of a <i>hard</i> brush, dipped in turpentine or lye, is
extremely injurious to the finest parts, as by this means most delicate
lines are not unfrequently broken. The use of anything damp to clean the
cuts when the pressman finishes his day’s-work, is to be avoided; as a
very small degree of damp is sufficient to cause the block to warp when
left locked up over night in the form. Whenever it is practicable, the
cuts ought to be taken out of the form at night, and placed on their
edges till next morning; as, by thus receiving a free circulation of air
all round them, they will be much less liable to warp, than if allowed
to remain in the form. As wood-cuts
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page650" id = "page650">
650</a></span>
are often injured by being carelessly printed in a rough proof, it is
advisable not to insert them in the form till all the literal
corrections are made, and the text is ready for the press.</p>

<p>It is a fact, though I am unable to satisfactorily account for it,
that an impression from a wood-block, taken by a common press, without
overlaying, or any other kind of preparation, is generally lighter in
the middle than towards the edges. Mr. Edward Cowper, who has
contributed so much to the improvement of machine-printing, when engaged
in making experiments with common presses constructed with the greatest
care,<a class = "tag" name = "tagIX41" id = "tagIX41" href =
"#noteIX41">IX.41</a> informs me, that he frequently noticed the same
defect. Such inequality in the impression is not perceptible in cuts
printed by a steam-press, where the pressure proceeds from a
<i>cylinder</i> instead of a flat platten of metal or wood. Besides the
advantage which the steam-press possesses over the common press in
producing a uniformly regular impression, the ink in the former method
is more equally distributed over every part of the form in consequence
of the undeviating regularity of the action of the inking rollers.
Though an equal distribution of the ink be of great advantage when all
the cuts in a form require to be printed in the same manner,&mdash;that
is, when all are of a similar <i>tone</i> of colour,&mdash;yet when some
are dark, and others comparatively light, balls faced with composition
are decidedly preferable to composition rollers, as by using the former
the pressman can give to each cut its proper quantity of ink.</p>

<p>I very much doubt, if soft composition rollers, such as are now
generally used, be so well adapted as composition balls for inking
wood-cuts engraved on a <i>plane</i> surface. The material of which the
rollers are formed is so soft and elastic, that it does not only pass
over the surface of the block, but penetrates to a certain depth between
the lines, thus inking them at the sides, as well as on their surface.
The consequence of this is, that when the pressure is too great, the
paper is forced in between the lines, and receives, to the great
detriment of the impression, a&nbsp;portion of the ink communicated by
the soft and elastic roller to their sides. For inking cuts delicately
engraved on <i>unlowered</i> blocks, I&nbsp;should recommend composition
balls instead of composition rollers, whenever it is required that such
cuts should be printed in the <i>best</i> manner.</p>

<p>The great advantage which modern wood engraving possesses over every
other branch of graphic art, is the cheap rate at which its productions
can be disseminated in conjunction with types, by means of the press.
This is the stronghold of the art; and whenever it has been abandoned in
modern times to compete with copper-plate engraving, in point of
delicacy or mere difficulty of execution, the result has been
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page651" id = "page651">
651</a></span>
a failure. No large modern wood-cuts, published separately, and resting
on their own merits as works of art, have repaid the engraver. The price
at which they were published was too high to allow of their being
purchased by the humbler classes, while the more wealthy collectors of
fine prints have treated them with neglect. Such persons were not
inclined to purchase comparatively expensive wood-cuts merely as
curiosities, showing how closely the peculiarities of copper-plate
engraving could be imitated on wood.</p>

<p>Though most of the large cuts designed by Albert Durer were either
published separately without letter-press, or in parts with brief
explanations annexed; yet we cannot ascribe the favour with which they
were unquestionably received, to the mere fact of their being executed
<i>on wood</i>. They were adapted to the taste and feelings of the age,
and were esteemed on account of the interest of the subjects and the
excellence of the designs. Were a modern artist of comparatively equal
talent to publish a series of subjects of excellence and originality,
engraved on wood in the best manner, I&nbsp;have little doubt of their
being favourably received; their success, however, would not be owing to
the circumstance of their being engraved on wood, but to their intrinsic
merits as works of art.</p>

<p>On taking a retrospective glance at the history of wood engraving, it
will be perceived that the art has not been regularly progressive. At
one period we find its productions distinguished for excellence of
design and freedom of execution, and at another we find mere mechanical
labour substituted for the talent of the artist. As soon as this change
commenced, wood engraving, as a means of multiplying works of art began
to decline. It continued in a state of neglect for upwards of a century,
and showed little symptoms of revival until the works of Bewick again
brought it into notice.</p>

<p>The maxim that “a good thing is valuable in proportion as many can
enjoy it,” may be applied with peculiar propriety to wood engraving; for
the productions of no other kindred art have been more generally
disseminated, nor with greater advantage to those for whom they were
intended. In the child’s first book wood-cuts are introduced, to enable
the infant mind to connect words with things; the youth gains his
knowledge of the forms of foreign animals from wood-cuts; and the
mathematician avails himself of wood engraving to execute his diagrams.
It has been employed, in the representation of religious subjects, as an
aid to devotion; to celebrate the triumphs of kings and warriors; to
illustrate the pages of the historian, the traveller, and the poet; and
by its means copies of the works of the greatest artists of former
times, have been afforded at a price which enabled the very poorest
classes to become purchasers. As at least one hundred thousand good
impressions
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page652" id = "page652">
652</a></span>
can be obtained from a wood-cut, if properly engraved and carefully
printed; and as the additional cost of printing wood-cuts with
letter-press is inconsiderable when compared with the cost of printing
steel or copper plates separately, the art will never want
encouragement, nor again sink into neglect, so long as there are artists
of talent to furnish designs, and good engravers to execute them.</p>

with a first proof taken on India paper, which paper, being dry when the

This mode of repairing a block was practised by the German wood
engravers of the time of Albert Durer. The “plug” which they inserted
was usually square, and not circular as at present. The French wood
engravers of the time of Papillon continued to employ square plugs.

When there is any danger of the block splitting from this cause, it is
best to have a cast taken from it, as by this means the whole is
obtained of one solid piece.</p>

The first work containing lowered cuts printed by a steam-press was that
on Cattle, published in numbers, under the superintendence of the
Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge, 1832.</p>

If the drawing were finished, the lines on the parts intended to be
light would necessarily be effaced in lowering the block in such
parts.</p>

In cuts printed by a steam-press it not unfrequently happens that
lowering to the depth of the sixteenth part of an inch scarcely produces
a perceptible difference in the strength of the impression. In cuts
inked with leather balls, and printed at the common press, the lines in
parts lowered to this depth would not be visible.</p>

Sir William Congreve’s mode of colour printing, however, patented many
years ago, and now practised by Mr. Charles Whiting of Beaufort House,
is one of the least expensive of all. It consists in printing several
colours at one time, and may be thus described:&mdash;“A coloured design
being made on a block, the various colours are cut into their respective
sections, like a geographical puzzle, and placed in an ingeniously
constructed machine, which inks them separately, and prints them
together. By this mode speed is obtained in large operations, and the
colours are prevented from running into each other. It is extensively
applied to book-covers, decorative show-cards, the back of country
notes, and labels, where the object is to prevent forgery.”&mdash;<i>See
Bohn’s Lecture on Printing, page 104.</i></p>

The best specimen of this art will be found in Charles Knight’s Old
England’s Worthies, a&nbsp;folio volume, containing twelve large plates
of Architecture and Costume, printed in colours, and 240 portraits
engraved on steel, folio (now published by H.&nbsp;G. Bohn), 15<i>s.</i>
The practice of the art has not been continued, as it was only
applicable to very large editions (ten thousand and upwards), and was
more expensive than hand colouring where small editions were required.
The machinery has been sold off and destroyed.</p>

The Book of Thel, which, with the titles, consists of seven quarto pages
of verse and figures engraved in metallic relief, is dated 1789.
A&nbsp;full list of the works of this remarkable artist will be found in
Bohn’s enlarged edition of Lowndes’s Bibliographer’s Manual.</p>

A cast from a form of types, as well as from an engraved wood-block, is
by French printers termed a <i>cliché</i>.</p>

The metal of which this matrix is formed, is made several degrees harder
than common type metal, by mixing with the latter a greater portion of
regulus of antimony, otherwise the matrix and cast would adhere.</p>

The principal difference, so far as relates to wood engravings, between
printing by a steam-press with cylindrical rollers, and printing by a
common press with a blanket, is, that the blanket or woollen cloth
covering the cylinder of the steam-press comes into immediate contact
with the paper, while in the common press the parchment of the tympan is
interposed between the paper and the blanket. It is necessary that cuts
intended to be printed by a steam-press should be lowered to a greater
depth than cuts intended to be printed with a blanket at a common press,
as the blanket on the cylinder penetrates to a greater depth between the
lines.</p>

I have known a printer, who <i>once</i> had a high character for his
<i>fine</i> work, charge and receive twelve guineas per sheet for a book
containing a number of wood-cuts which required to be well printed, and
I have known a similar work better printed from lowered blocks for less
than half the sum per sheet. Publishers will at no distant time
discover, that it is their interest rather to have their cuts first
properly engraved than to pay a printer a large additional sum for the
trouble of overlaying them, and thus giving them the appearance which
they ought to have without such means and appliances, if the blocks were
originally executed as they ought to be.</p>

The cuts being arranged back to back, as at pages 641, 642, and thereby
preventing the types appearing, as they do on the next page, is an
advantage not to be overlooked.</p>

What is called <i>underlaying</i> consists in pasting one piece of paper
or more on the lower part of a block, in order to raise it, and increase
the pressure. When a block is uneven at the bottom, in consequence of
warping, underlaying is indispensable.</p>

The entire quantity of types, or of types and wood-cuts, which is locked
up together, and printed on one side of a sheet at one impression, is
called by printers a <i>form</i>.</p>

When a block, after being printed, requires retouching, it is generally
necessary to cover it with fine whiting, which, by filling up the
interstices, thus enables the engraver to distinguish the raised lines
more clearly.</p>

When a block has been cleaned with turpentine, and not afterwards washed
with soap and water, it will not receive the ink well when next used.
The first fifty or sixty impressions subsequently taken, are almost
certain to have a grey and scumbled appearance.</p>

Some of those presses were so truly constructed, that if the table were
wetted, and brought in contact with the platten, it could be raised from
its bed by allowing the platten to ascend, in consequence of the two
surfaces being so perfectly plane and level.</p>
